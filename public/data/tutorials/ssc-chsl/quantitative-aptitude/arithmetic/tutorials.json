      "content": "Age problems involve relationships between ages at different times.\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. If current age is x, then:\n   - Age after n years = x + n\n   - Age before n years = x - n\n\n2. If age after n years is y, then:\n   - Current age = y - n\n\n3. If age before n years was y, then:\n   - Current age = y + n\n\n**Common Types:**\n\n**Type 1: Ratio of Ages**\n\n**Example:**\nPresent age ratio of A:B is 3:4\nAfter 5 years, ratio will be 4:5\nFind present ages.\n\nLet present ages be 3x and 4x\nAfter 5 years: (3x+5):(4x+5) = 4:5\n\nCross multiply:\n5(3x+5) = 4(4x+5)\n15x + 25 = 16x + 20\nx = 5\n\nPresent ages: A = 15 years, B = 20 years\n\n**Type 2: Sum and Difference**\n\n**Example:**\nSum of ages of A and B is 50\nDifference is 10\nFind ages.\n\nA + B = 50\nA - B = 10\n\nAdding: 2A = 60, so A = 30\nB = 50 - 30 = 20\n\n**Type 3: Age Relations at Different Times**\n\n**Example:**\nFather is 30 years older than son\nAfter 10 years, father will be twice the son's age\nFind present ages.\n\nLet son's age = x\nFather's age = x + 30\n\nAfter 10 years:\nFather = x + 40\nSon = x + 10\n\nGiven: x + 40 = 2(x + 10)\nx + 40 = 2x + 20\nx = 20\n\nPresent ages: Son = 20, Father = 50"

      "content": "**Strategy for SSC CHSL Arithmetic Section:**\n\n**1. Topic-wise Priority (Based on frequency):**\n- High Priority: Percentages, Profit-Loss, SI-CI, Averages\n- Medium Priority: Time-Work, Speed-Distance, Ratio\n- Lower Priority: Ages, Number system applications\n\n**2. Time Allocation:**\n- Easy questions (concept-based): 30-45 seconds\n- Medium questions (calculation): 60-90 seconds\n- Difficult questions: Skip or attempt last\n\n**3. Calculation Tips:**\n- Use options for back-calculation\n- Approximate when possible\n- Eliminate obviously wrong options\n- Verify answer makes logical sense\n\n**4. Common Shortcuts:**\n\n**Percentage to Fraction:**\n- 10% = 1/10, 20% = 1/5, 25% = 1/4\n- 33.33% = 1/3, 50% = 1/2\n- 66.67% = 2/3, 75% = 3/4\n\n**Squares (memorize 1-30):**\n- 11² = 121, 12² = 144, 13² = 169\n- 14² = 196, 15² = 225, 16² = 256\n- 17² = 289, 18² = 324, 19² = 361\n- 20² = 400, 25² = 625, 30² = 900\n\n**Multiplication Tricks:**\n- × 11: 23 × 11 = 2(2+3)3 = 253\n- × 99: 45 × 99 = 45 × 100 - 45 = 4455\n\n**5. Avoid These Mistakes:**\n❌ Not reading question completely\n❌ Calculation errors in hurry\n❌ Confusing formulas\n❌ Not using elimination method\n❌ Spending too much time on one question\n\n**6. Practice Strategy:**\n- Solve 20-25 questions daily\n- Time yourself\n- Maintain error log\n- Focus on weak areas\n- Revise formulas regularly"
