      "title": "Mean (Arithmetic Average)",
      "content": "**Mean:**\nThe arithmetic average of a set of numbers.\n\n**Formula:**\nMean = Sum of all observations / Number of observations\n\n**Symbol:** x̄ (x-bar) or μ (mu)\n\n**Example 1:**\nFind the mean of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\n\nMean = (5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25) / 5\n     = 75 / 5\n     = 15\n\n**Types of Mean:**\n\n**1. Simple Mean (Direct Method):**\nMean = Σx / n\nwhere Σx = sum of all values, n = number of values\n\n**2. Weighted Mean:**\nWhen different items have different importance (weights)\n\nWeighted Mean = Σ(w × x) / Σw\nwhere w = weight, x = value\n\n**Example:**\nStudent scores 60 (weight 30%), 80 (weight 70%)\nWeighted Mean = (30×60 + 70×80) / (30+70)\n              = (1800 + 5600) / 100\n              = 74\n\n**3. Mean of Frequency Distribution:**\nMean = Σ(f × x) / Σf\nwhere f = frequency, x = value\n\n**Example:**\nValue (x): 10, 20, 30\nFrequency (f): 2, 3, 5\n\nMean = (2×10 + 3×20 + 5×30) / (2+3+5)\n     = (20 + 60 + 150) / 10\n     = 230 / 10\n     = 23\n\n**Properties of Mean:**\n\n1. Sum of deviations from mean = 0\n2. If all values increased by k, mean increases by k\n3. If all values multiplied by k, mean multiplied by k\n4. Affected by extreme values (outliers)\n\n**Relation with Sum:**\nSum = Mean × Number of observations\n\n**Combined Mean:**\nIf two groups have means m₁ and m₂ with n₁ and n₂ observations:\n\nCombined Mean = (n₁m₁ + n₂m₂) / (n₁ + n₂)"

Find the middle value\n\n**Formulas:**\n\n**For n observations:**\n\n**If n is odd:**\nMedian = Value at position (n+1)/2\n\n**If n is even:**\nMedian = Average of values at positions n/2 and (n/2 + 1)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Odd number of observations):**\nFind median of: 5, 2, 8, 3, 7\n\nStep 1: Arrange in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8\nStep 2: n = 5 (odd)\nMedian position = (5+1)/2 = 3rd value\nMedian = 5\n\n**Example 2 (Even number of observations):**\nFind median of: 10, 20, 30, 40\n\nStep 1: Already in order\nStep 2: n = 4 (even)\nMedian = Average of 2nd and 3rd values\nMedian = (20 + 30)/2 = 25\n\n**Example 3:**\nFind median of: 15, 10, 25, 5, 20\n\nArrange: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\nn = 5 (odd)\nMedian = 3rd value = 15\n\n**Properties of Median:**\n\n1. Not affected by extreme values (outliers)\n2. Divides data into two equal halves\n3. Best for skewed distributions\n4. Can be found for ordinal data\n\n**Median vs Mean:**\n\n**Use Median when:**\n- Data has extreme values\n- Distribution is skewed\n- Example: Income data (few very high incomes)\n\n**Use Mean when:**\n- Data is symmetric\n- No extreme outliers\n- Need precise calculation\n\n**Relation:**\n- In symmetric distribution: Mean = Median\n- In right-skewed: Mean > Median\n- In left-skewed: Mean < Median"
