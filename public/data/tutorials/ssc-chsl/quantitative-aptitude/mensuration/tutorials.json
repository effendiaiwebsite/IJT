      "title": "Introduction to Mensuration",
      "content": "Mensuration is the branch of mathematics that deals with the measurement of geometric figures and their parameters such as length, area, volume, and perimeter. The word 'mensuration' comes from the Latin word 'mensura' which means 'to measure'.\n\nMensuration is used extensively in everyday life - from calculating the area of a plot of land, the amount of paint needed for a wall, the capacity of a water tank, to the volume of a room. In SSC GD exams, mensuration questions test your understanding of geometric formulas and your ability to apply them to practical problems.\n\nMensuration is broadly divided into two categories:\n\n**1. Plane Mensuration (2D Figures):** Deals with flat, two-dimensional figures like squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles. We calculate perimeter and area for these figures.\n\n**2. Solid Mensuration (3D Figures):** Deals with three-dimensional objects like cubes, cuboids, cylinders, cones, and spheres. We calculate surface area and volume for these figures."

      "content": "Let's start with the most common 2D shapes:\n\n**SQUARE:**\nA square is a four-sided figure with all sides equal and all angles 90°.\n\nIf side of square = a, then:\n- **Perimeter** = 4a (sum of all four sides)\n- **Area** = a² (side × side)\n- **Diagonal** = a√2\n\nExample: If side of a square is 5 cm, then:\nPerimeter = 4 × 5 = 20 cm\nArea = 5² = 25 cm²\n\n**RECTANGLE:**\nA rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles 90°.\n\nIf length = l and breadth = b, then:\n- **Perimeter** = 2(l + b) (sum of all four sides)\n- **Area** = l × b (length × breadth)\n- **Diagonal** = √(l² + b²)\n\nExample: If length is 8 cm and breadth is 5 cm:\nPerimeter = 2(8 + 5) = 2 × 13 = 26 cm\nArea = 8 × 5 = 40 cm²\n\nKey point: In a square, length = breadth = side."
