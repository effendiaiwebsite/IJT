        "id": "cloze-test-practice-1",
        "text": "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to __(1)__ the world. It is through education that the daughter of a farmer can become a doctor, and the son of a coal miner can become the __(2)__ of the country.",

          "(1) change, (2) president",

          "(1) leave, (2) servant"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Correct answer: (1) change, (2) president\n\n**Blank 1:** The phrase 'powerful weapon to ___ the world' requires a positive word. 'Change' fits perfectly as education brings positive transformation. 'Destroy' is negative, 'transform' could work but 'change' is more commonly used with this phrase. 'Leave' doesn't make sense.\n\n**Blank 2:** The parallel structure 'daughter of a farmer can become a doctor' suggests an ambitious role. 'President' fits this pattern best (high position). 'Leader' is too vague, 'citizen' is too ordinary, and 'servant' doesn't match the aspirational tone.\n\nThe passage emphasizes education's power to enable social mobility and achievement."

      "content": "Grammar is your best friend in cloze tests. Look for these clues:\n\n**1. Articles (a, an, the):**\n- 'A/an' before the blank → Singular countable noun needed\n- 'The' before the blank → Specific noun needed\n\n**2. Prepositions:**\n- Certain verbs/adjectives go with specific prepositions\n- Interested __in__, good __at__, depend __on__\n\n**3. Conjunctions:**\n- 'And' → Similar/parallel idea\n- 'But/However' → Contrasting idea\n- 'Because/Since' → Reason follows\n- 'Although/Though' → Contradiction\n\n**4. Verb Forms:**\n- Check if present/past/future is needed\n- Singular or plural verb\n- Active or passive voice\n\n**5. Adjective/Adverb:**\n- If describing a noun → Adjective\n- If describing a verb/adjective → Adverb (usually -ly)\n\n**6. Parallel Structure:**\n- 'Not only...but also' → Similar forms\n- 'Either...or' / 'Neither...nor' → Parallel structure\n\n**Example:**\nShe is not only intelligent but also __(blank)__.\nOptions: (a) hardworking (b) works hard (c) hard work (d) worked\nAnswer: (a) hardworking (parallel adjective form)"

Definition Clues:**\nThe blank is defined or explained in the same sentence.\nExample: A herbivore is an animal that __(eats)__ only plants.\n\n**2. Synonym Clues:**\nA similar word is used nearby.\nExample: The movie was boring and __(dull)__.\n\n**3. Antonym Clues:**\nAn opposite word gives a hint (look for 'but', 'however', 'although').\nExample: Unlike his cheerful brother, he was very __(sad/gloomy)__.\n\n**4. Example Clues:**\nExamples help identify the blank.\nExample: Many birds like eagles, hawks, and __(falcons)__ are carnivorous.\n\n**5. Cause and Effect:**\n'Because', 'therefore', 'as a result' indicate cause-effect relationship.\nExample: Because it rained heavily, the match was __(postponed/cancelled)__."

      "content": "**6. Tone/Mood Clues:**\nThe overall tone of the passage helps.\n- Positive passage → positive words in blanks\n- Negative passage → negative words in blanks\n\nExample: The celebration was filled with joy, laughter, and __(happiness)__.\n(Positive tone requires positive word)\n\n**7. Logical Sequence:**\nThe blank should maintain logical flow.\nExample: First, he woke up. Then, he __(brushed)__ his teeth. After that, he had breakfast.\n\n**8. Common Collocations:**\nSome words naturally go together.\n- Make a decision (not 'do a decision')\n- Heavy rain (not 'strong rain')\n- Pay attention (not 'give attention')\n- Take care (not 'make care')\n\n**9. Time Indicators:**\nWords like 'now', 'then', 'before', 'after' guide verb tense.\nExample: He __(worked)__ there for 5 years before moving to Delhi.\n(Past action before another past action → past perfect or simple past)\n\n**10. Pronoun References:**\nCheck what the pronoun refers to for context.\nExample: The students were excited because __(they)__ won the competition."

          "(1) simple, (2) problems"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Correct answer: (1) serious, (2) signs\n\n**Blank 1:** The context discusses climate change as a 'challenge facing humanity' with negative effects mentioned. This requires a strong, negative adjective. 'Serious' fits perfectly. 'Easy' and 'minor' contradict the severity implied. 'Simple' doesn't convey the magnitude.\n\n**Blank 2:** The sentence lists 'rising temperatures, melting glaciers, extreme weather events' as examples. These are 'signs' or indicators of distress. 'Solutions' and 'benefits' are positive (doesn't fit negative context). 'Problems' could work but 'signs' better fits the structure 'clear ___ that...'\n\nThe passage emphasizes the seriousness of climate change through observable indicators."

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Correct answer: (1) transform, (2) electronically\n\n**Blank 1:** The context is about Digital India making India 'digitally empowered'. The blank needs a strong positive verb. 'Transform' means to make a thorough or dramatic change, which fits perfectly with the ambitious goal. 'Change' and 'convert' are weaker. 'Break' is negative and illogical.\n\n**Blank 2:** The phrase 'through online infrastructure' indicates the mode of service delivery. 'Electronically' fits perfectly with online/digital theme. 'Manually' is the opposite of digital. 'Slowly' and 'partially' don't relate to the digital nature.\n\nThe passage emphasizes comprehensive digital transformation through electronic means."
