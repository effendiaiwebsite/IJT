      "content": "Direct and Indirect Speech (also called Narration) is about reporting what someone said. Understanding narration is essential for clear communication and scoring well in SSC MTS.\n\nWhat is Speech/Narration:\n- The way we report or tell what someone has said\n- Two forms: Direct Speech and Indirect Speech\n\nDirect Speech:\n- Exact words spoken by someone\n- Uses quotation marks (\" \")\n- Reporting verb: say, said, says\n- Example: Ram said, \"I am going to Delhi.\"\n\nIndirect Speech:\n- Reported form of what someone said\n- No quotation marks\n- Reporting verb often changes\n- Example: Ram said that he was going to Delhi.\n\nComponents of Speech:\n\n1. Reporting Verb:\n- The verb that introduces the speech\n- Examples: say, said, tell, told, ask, asked\n- Direct: Ram said, \"...\"\n- Indirect: Ram said that...\n\n2. Reported Speech:\n- The actual words spoken (in direct)\n- The reported content (in indirect)\n- Changes occur here during conversion\n\nWhy Learn This:\n1. Common question type in SSC MTS\n2. Essential for storytelling and reporting\n3. Tests grammar knowledge (tenses, pronouns)\n4. Improves communication skills\n5. Used in everyday conversations\n\nKey Changes in Conversion:\n1. Remove quotation marks\n2. Add 'that' after reporting verb\n3. Change pronouns (I → he/she)\n4. Change tenses (present → past)\n5. Change time and place words\n6. Change demonstratives (this → that)\n\nTypes of Sentences:\n1. Assertive/Declarative (statements)\n2. Interrogative (questions)\n3. Imperative (commands/requests)\n4. Exclamatory (exclamations)\n5. Optative (wishes)\n\nFor SSC MTS, focus on:\n- Basic conversion rules\n- Tense changes\n- Pronoun changes\n- Question conversion"

SIMPLE PRESENT → SIMPLE PAST:\n\nDirect: He said, \"I work hard.\"\nIndirect: He said that he worked hard.\n\nDirect: She said, \"Ram goes to school.\"\nIndirect: She said that Ram went to school.\n\n2.

      "content": "Complete strategy for mastering narration for SSC MTS:\n\n1. Identification Strategy:\n\nDirect Speech Indicators:\n- Quotation marks (\" \")\n- Comma before quotation\n- First letter of quoted part is capitalized\n- Structure: Said, \"...\"\n\nIndirect Speech Indicators:\n- No quotation marks\n- Uses 'that', 'if/whether', or question words\n- Tense changes applied\n- Structure: Said that...\n\n2. Conversion Steps (Direct to Indirect):\n\nStep 1: Identify sentence type (statement/question/command/exclamation)\nStep 2: Remove quotation marks and comma\nStep 3: Change reporting verb if needed (said→asked, told→requested)\nStep 4: Add connecting word (that/if/whether/question word)\nStep 5: Change pronouns (I→he/she, you→I/him/her)\nStep 6: Change tense (present→past, past→past perfect)\nStep 7: Change time/place words (now→then, today→that day)\nStep 8: Change demonstratives (this→that, these→those)\n\n3. Quick Reference:\n\nSentence Type → Structure:\n- Statement: said that + changed speech\n- Wh-Question: asked + wh-word + changed speech\n- Yes/No Question: asked if/whether + changed speech\n- Command: ordered + to + verb\n- Request: requested + to + verb\n- Advice: advised + to + verb\n- Exclamation: exclaimed with emotion + that + changed speech\n- Wish: wished/prayed + that + might + verb\n\n4. Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- Using 'that' with questions\n- Forgetting to change tenses\n- Not changing pronouns correctly\n- Using question form in indirect questions\n- Wrong reporting verb for imperative\n- Forgetting time/place changes\n\n5. Practice Plan:\n\nWeek 1-2: Assertive sentences\n- All tenses\n- 10 conversions daily\n\nWeek 3-4: Questions\n- Wh-questions and Yes/No questions\n- 15 conversions daily\n\nWeek 5-6: Commands, exclamations, wishes\n- Mixed sentence types\n- 15 conversions daily\n\nWeek 7-8: Full practice\n- All types mixed\n- Previous year questions\n- Time yourself\n\n6. Exam Tips:\n- Read the sentence carefully\n- Identify sentence type first\n- Note the tense of reporting verb\n- Apply changes systematically\n- Check pronoun changes twice\n- Verify time/place words\n- Don't skip any step\n\n7. Memory Tricks:\n\n- Tense Backward Rule: In indirect, tenses move one step back\n  Present→Past, Past→Past Perfect\n\n- Pronoun POV: Think from reporter's point of view\n  \"I\" in direct = \"he/she\" (the speaker) in indirect\n\n- Question Test: If direct has '?', indirect doesn't need '?'\n\n- 'Please' = Request: Always use 'requested'\n\n- Time Travel: All time words move away from present\n  today→that day, tomorrow→next day\n\nConsistent practice is the key to mastering narration!"
