      "content": "Sentence Correction tests your ability to identify and correct grammatical errors in sentences. This is a critical skill for SSC MTS as it evaluates your understanding of English grammar rules and proper sentence construction.\n\nWhy Sentence Correction is Important:\n1. Tests practical application of grammar rules\n2. Improves writing and speaking skills\n3. Essential for professional communication\n4. Frequently asked in SSC MTS exams\n5. Builds eye for detail\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n- Spotting Errors (identifying mistakes in sentences)\n- Sentence Improvement (choosing better alternatives)\n- Phrase Replacement (replacing incorrect phrases)\n\nTypes of Questions:\n1. Error Detection: Find the part with error\n2. Sentence Improvement: Replace incorrect part\n3. Phrase Replacement: Choose correct phrase\n\nCommon Error Types:\n1. Subject-Verb Agreement errors\n2. Tense errors\n3. Article errors\n4. Preposition errors\n5. Pronoun errors\n6. Word usage errors\n7. Modifier errors\n8. Parallel structure errors\n\nStudy Approach:\n- Understand grammar rules thoroughly\n- Practice identifying different error types\n- Read correct sentences to develop intuition\n- Solve previous year questions\n- Learn from mistakes\n\nFor SSC MTS, focus on basic grammar rules and common error patterns rather than complex constructions."

      "content": "Subject-Verb Agreement is the most common error type. The subject and verb must agree in number (singular/plural).\n\nCommon Agreement Errors:\n\n1. Singular Subject with Plural Verb (or vice versa):\nWrong: He go to school.\nCorrect: He goes to school.\n\nWrong: They goes to school.\nCorrect: They go to school.\n\n2. Collective Nouns:\nWrong: The team are playing well.\nCorrect: The team is playing well.\n(Team is singular despite having many members)\n\n3. Either/Neither with Or/Nor:\nWrong: Either Ram or Shyam are coming.\nCorrect: Either Ram or Shyam is coming.\n(Both subjects singular = singular verb)\n\nWrong: Neither the teacher nor the students is present.\nCorrect: Neither the teacher nor the students are present.\n(Verb agrees with nearest subject 'students')\n\n4. Each/Every:\nWrong: Each student have a book.\nCorrect: Each student has a book.\n\nWrong: Every boy were present.\nCorrect: Every boy was present.\n\n5. Indefinite Pronouns:\nWrong: Everyone are happy.\nCorrect: Everyone is happy.\n(Everyone, somebody, nobody → singular verb)\n\n6.

There is/There are:\nWrong: There is many students.\nCorrect: There are many students.\n(Verb agrees with the noun following 'there')\n\nDetection Strategy:\n- Identify the subject first\n- Determine if subject is singular or plural\n- Check if verb matches the subject\n- Watch for tricky collective nouns and indefinite pronouns"

Since vs. For:\nWrong: I have been studying for morning.\nCorrect: I have been studying since morning.\n(Since = point in time, For = duration)\n\nWrong: He has worked here since five years.\nCorrect: He has worked here for five years.\n\n4. Before/After with Perfect Tense:\nWrong: I finished my work before you came.\nCorrect: I had finished my work before you came.\n(Use past perfect for action completed before another past action)\n\n5. Future in Time Clauses:\nWrong: I will call you when I will reach.\nCorrect: I will call you when I reach.\n(No 'will' in time clauses with when, after, before)\n\n6. Stative Verbs:\nWrong: I am understanding the concept.\nCorrect: I understand the concept.\n(Know, understand, love, hate, etc. → simple tenses)\n\n7. Present Perfect vs. Simple Past:\nWrong: I have seen him yesterday.\nCorrect: I saw him yesterday.\n(Specific past time = simple past, not present perfect)\n\nDetection Strategy:\n- Look for time markers (yesterday, since, for, tomorrow)\n- Check if tense matches the time expression\n- Ensure tense consistency in compound sentences\n- Watch for stative verbs in continuous form"
