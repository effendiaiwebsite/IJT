      "title": "Introduction to Analogies",
      "content": "An analogy is a comparison between two things that shows a relationship or pattern. In reasoning exams like SSC MTS, analogy questions test your ability to identify the relationship between a pair of items and apply the same relationship to find another similar pair.\n\nAnalogy questions follow the format: A : B :: C : ?\nThis reads as 'A is to B as C is to what?'\n\nTypes of Analogies:\n1. Number Analogies - Based on mathematical relationships\n2. Letter Analogies - Based on alphabetical positions and patterns\n3. Word Analogies - Based on meanings, relationships, categories\n4. Figure Analogies - Based on visual patterns (not covered in text-based learning)\n\nUnderstanding analogies improves your pattern recognition, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills - all essential for competitive exams and real-life situations."

      "content": "Number analogies are based on mathematical relationships between numbers. The key is to identify the operation or pattern connecting the first pair and apply it to the second pair.\n\nCommon Number Patterns:\n\n1. Addition/Subtraction:\nExample: 3 : 5 :: 7 : ?\nRelation: 3 + 2 = 5, so 7 + 2 = 9\nAnswer: 9\n\n2. Multiplication/Division:\nExample: 4 : 12 :: 5 : ?\nRelation: 4 × 3 = 12, so 5 × 3 = 15\nAnswer: 15\n\n3. Squares and Cubes:\nExample: 2 : 4 :: 3 : ?\nRelation: 2² = 4, so 3² = 9\nAnswer: 9\n\n4. Difference Pattern:\nExample: 5 : 25 :: 7 : ?\nRelation: 5² = 25, so 7² = 49\nAnswer: 49\n\n5. Combined Operations:\nExample: 3 : 10 :: 4 : ?\nRelation: 3² + 1 = 10, so 4² + 1 = 17\nAnswer: 17\n\nTip: Always check multiple possibilities and verify with both pairs."

Position-based:\nExample: A : C :: B : ?\nRelation: A (1) + 2 = C (3), so B (2) + 2 = D (4)\nAnswer: D\n\n2. Skipping Letters:\nExample: B : E :: D : ?\nRelation: B → skip 2 letters → E, so D → skip 2 → G\nAnswer: G\n\n3. Opposite Letters:\nExample: A : Z :: B : ?\nRelation: A and Z are opposite (1st and 26th), so B's opposite is Y (2nd and 25th)\nAnswer: Y\n\n4. Vowel-Consonant:\nExample: A : B :: E : ?\nRelation: Vowel followed by next consonant\nAnswer: F\n\n5. Letter Code:\nExample: CAT : DBU :: DOG : ?\nRelation: Each letter +1: C→D, A→B, T→U, so D→E, O→P, G→H\nAnswer: EPH\n\nTip: Write down alphabet if needed: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z"

      "content": "Word analogies test your vocabulary and understanding of word relationships. The most common types involve synonyms (similar meaning) and antonyms (opposite meaning).\n\n1. Synonym Analogies:\nExample: Happy : Joyful :: Sad : ?\nRelation: Happy and Joyful are synonyms, so find synonym of Sad\nAnswer: Sorrowful / Unhappy\n\n2. Antonym Analogies:\nExample: Hot : Cold :: Day : ?\nRelation: Hot and Cold are opposites, so opposite of Day\nAnswer: Night\n\n3. Degree/Intensity:\nExample: Warm : Hot :: Cool : ?\nRelation: Warm is mild form of Hot, Cool is mild form of Cold\nAnswer: Cold\n\n4.

      "content": "Master Strategy for Solving Analogies:\n\n1. Identify the Relationship:\n- Read both items in the first pair carefully\n- Determine what connects them (opposite, same, part-whole, cause-effect, etc.)\n- State the relationship in a sentence\n\n2. Apply the Relationship:\n- Take the third item\n- Apply the same relationship\n- Predict the answer before looking at options\n\n3. Verify with Options:\n- Check if your prediction matches an option\n- If not, reconsider the relationship\n- Eliminate clearly wrong options\n\n4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid:\n- Don't assume the first relationship you see is correct\n- Check if the relationship works in both directions\n- Be careful with similar-sounding words\n- Watch for multiple valid relationships\n\n5. Time-Saving Tips:\n- Practice common analogy types\n- Build vocabulary for word analogies\n- Memorize alphabet positions for letter analogies\n- Look for the simplest relationship first\n\nPractice Approach:\nSolve 10-15 analogy questions daily to improve pattern recognition speed and accuracy."
