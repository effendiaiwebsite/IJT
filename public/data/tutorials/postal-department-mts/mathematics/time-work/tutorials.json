      "title": "Introduction to Time and Work",
      "content": "Time and Work is an important topic in Postal Department MTS exam that deals with the relationship between work done, time taken, and efficiency of workers.\n\n**Basic Concept:**\nTime and Work problems are based on the principle that:\n**Work = Time × Efficiency**\n\n**Fundamental Assumptions:**\n- Work is considered as one unit (1 work)\n- If a person completes work in n days, his one day's work = 1/n\n- If one day's work is 1/n, then total time = n days\n\n**Key Terms:**\n\n**Work:** The task to be completed (considered as 1 unit)\n**Time:** Duration taken to complete the work\n**Efficiency:** Work done per unit time (capacity/capability)\n**Rate of work:** Portion of work done per day/hour\n\n**Why Important?**\n- 2-3 questions guaranteed in exam\n- Logical and practical topic\n- Used in real-life project planning\n- Helps understand productivity concepts\n\n**Real-Life Applications:**\n- Workers completing a construction project\n- Filling tanks with pipes\n- Completing office work\n- Manufacturing products in factories\n\nUnderstanding basic concepts makes solving time-work problems easy and quick.",

More workers → Less time (Inverse relation)**\nIf m₁ men can do work in d₁ days, then m₂ men will do it in d₂ days:\nm₁ × d₁ = m₂ × d₂\n\n**2. Efficiency and Time (Inverse relation)**\nIf A is twice as efficient as B, A takes half the time\n\n**3. Work is constant**\nWorkers × Days = Constant (for same work)\n\n**Remember:** Work is always taken as 1 unit unless specified otherwise.",
