      "content": "Ratio and Proportion is a fundamental topic in mathematics that helps us compare quantities and establish relationships between numbers. This topic is crucial for Railway Group D Helper exam.\n\n**What is Ratio?**\nRatio is a comparison between two quantities of the same kind. It shows how many times one quantity contains another.\n\n**Representation:**\nRatio of a to b = a : b = a/b\n\n**Example:** If there are 15 boys and 10 girls in a class:\nRatio of boys to girls = 15 : 10 = 3 : 2\n\n**What is Proportion?**\nProportion means equality of two ratios. When two ratios are equal, they are said to be in proportion.\n\n**Representation:**\na : b = c : d or a/b = c/d\n\n**Why Important for Postal MTS?**\n- 3-4 direct questions from this topic\n- Used in age problems, mixture problems\n- Essential for partnership and time-work problems\n- Helps in solving real-life distribution problems\n\nUnderstanding ratio and proportion simplifies many complex problems in mathematics.",

      "content": "**Key Points about Ratios:**\n\n**1. Same Units Required:**\nBoth quantities must be in the same unit\nExample: 50 cm : 2 m = 50 cm : 200 cm = 1 : 4\n\n**2. Simplification:**\nAlways express ratio in simplest form\nExample: 24 : 36 = 2 : 3 (dividing by 12)\n\n**3. No Units in Ratio:**\nRatio is a pure number without units\n30 kg : 45 kg = 2 : 3 (not 2 kg : 3 kg)\n\n**4. Order Matters:**\n2 : 3 is different from 3 : 2\n\n**5. Compounded Ratio:**\nRatio of products of corresponding terms\n(a : b) and (c : d) → ac : bd\nExample: (2 : 3) and (4 : 5) → 8 : 15\n\n**6. Duplicate Ratio:**\nRatio of squares\na : b → a² : b²\nExample: 3 : 4 → 9 : 16\n\n**7. Sub-duplicate Ratio:**\nRatio of square roots\na : b → √a : √b\nExample: 9 : 16 → 3 : 4\n\n**8. Inverse/Reciprocal Ratio:**\na : b → b : a\nExample: 3 : 5 → 5 : 3",

      "content": "**Dividing a Quantity in Given Ratio:**\n\n**Formula:**\nIf a number N is divided in ratio a : b, then:\n- First part = N × a/(a+b)\n- Second part = N × b/(a+b)\n\n**Example 1:** Divide 500 in ratio 3 : 2\nSum of ratio = 3 + 2 = 5\nFirst part = 500 × 3/5 = 300\nSecond part = 500 × 2/5 = 200\nVerification: 300 + 200 = 500 ✓\n\n**Example 2:** Divide 1200 in ratio 2 : 3 : 5\nSum of ratio = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\nFirst part = 1200 × 2/10 = 240\nSecond part = 1200 × 3/10 = 360\nThird part = 1200 × 5/10 = 600\nVerification: 240 + 360 + 600 = 1200 ✓\n\n**Example 3:** Three friends share ₹750 in ratio 4 : 3 : 3\nSum = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10\nFirst friend: 750 × 4/10 = ₹300\nSecond friend: 750 × 3/10 = ₹225\nThird friend: 750 × 3/10 = ₹225\n\n**Quick Method:**\nFind one part value by dividing total by sum of ratios, then multiply by each ratio term.",

Direct Proportion:**\nWhen one increases, other also increases\nExample: More workers → More work done\nIf a/b = c/d, then a and c are directly proportional\n\n**2. Inverse Proportion:**\nWhen one increases, other decreases\nExample: More speed → Less time\nIf a × b = c × d, then a and c are inversely proportional\n\n**3. Continued Proportion:**\na : b = b : c\nb² = ac, and b is called mean proportional\nExample: 4 : 6 :: 6 : 9\n6² = 36 and 4 × 9 = 36 ✓",
