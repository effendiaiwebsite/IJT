      "content": "Classification questions test your ability to identify the odd one out from a group. You need to find the item that doesn't belong to the same category or pattern as others.\n\n**What is Classification?**\nClassification means grouping similar items together and identifying which item is different from the rest.\n\n**Format:**\nYou are given 4-5 options, and you need to find which ONE is different.\n\n**Example:**\nFind odd one out: Apple, Banana, Mango, Potato\nApple, Banana, Mango are fruits\nPotato is a vegetable\nAnswer: Potato (odd one)\n\n**Types of Classification:**\n1. **Number Classification** - Based on mathematical properties\n2. **Letter Classification** - Based on alphabet patterns\n3. **Word Classification** - Based on categories/meanings\n\n**Why Important?**\n- 2-3 questions guaranteed in exam\n- Tests observation skills\n- Improves logical thinking\n- Quick to solve once pattern is identified\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Look for what's common in 3-4 options\n- Identify which one doesn't fit\n- Consider multiple properties\n- The odd one will differ in significant way\n\nClassification questions reward careful observation and quick thinking.",

      "content": "**Common Number Properties to Check:**\n\n**1. Even vs Odd:**\n2, 4, 8, 15\nOdd one: 15 (only odd number)\n\n**2. Prime vs Composite:**\n3, 5, 7, 9\nOdd one: 9 (only composite, others are prime)\n\n**3. Perfect Squares:**\n4, 9, 16, 20\nOdd one: 20 (not a perfect square)\n\n**4. Perfect Cubes:**\n8, 27, 64, 100\nOdd one: 100 (not a perfect cube)\n\n**5. Divisibility Pattern:**\n10, 15, 20, 23\nOdd one: 23 (not divisible by 5)\n\n**6. Number Pattern:**\n2, 4, 8, 16, 24\nPattern: Powers of 2 (2¹, 2², 2³, 2⁴)\nOdd one: 24 (not a power of 2)\n\n**7. Sum of Digits:**\n12, 21, 30, 43\n1+2=3, 2+1=3, 3+0=3, 4+3=7\nOdd one: 43 (sum is different)\n\n**8. Number of Digits:**\n23, 45, 67, 123\nOdd one: 123 (three digits, others two)\n\n**Solving Steps:**\n1. Check if even/odd pattern exists\n2. Check prime/composite nature\n3. Check for perfect squares/cubes\n4. Look for arithmetic progression\n5. Check divisibility patterns",

Alphabetical Order:**\nACE, BDF, CEG, DFI\nPattern: Alternate letters\nACE: A(1), C(3), E(5) - difference 2\nBDF: B(2), D(4), F(6) - difference 2\nCEG: C(3), E(5), G(7) - difference 2\nDFI: D(4), F(6), I(9) - difference 2, then 3\nOdd one: DFI\n\n**6. Same Letter Repeated:**\nAAA, BBB, CCC, ABC\nOdd one: ABC (not repeated)\n\n**Tips:**\n- Check vowel/consonant classification\n- Check alphabetical positions\n- Look for patterns in letter sequences\n- Check if letters form meaningful groups\n\n**Quick Reference:**\nVowels: A, E, I, O, U (5 vowels)\nConsonants: All others (21 consonants)",
