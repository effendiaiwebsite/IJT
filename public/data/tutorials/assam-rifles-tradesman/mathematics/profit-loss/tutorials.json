      "title": "Basic Profit and Loss Formulas",
      "content": "**Fundamental Formulas:**\n\n**1. When Profit:**\n- Profit = SP - CP\n- SP = CP + Profit\n- CP = SP - Profit\n\n**2. When Loss:**\n- Loss = CP - SP\n- SP = CP - Loss\n- CP = SP + Loss\n\n**3. Profit Percentage:**\nProfit% = (Profit / CP) × 100\nProfit% = [(SP - CP) / CP] × 100\n\n**4. Loss Percentage:**\nLoss% = (Loss / CP) × 100\nLoss% = [(CP - SP) / CP] × 100\n\n**5. Finding SP from CP and Profit%:**\nSP = CP × (100 + Profit%) / 100\n\nExample: CP = ₹500, Profit% = 20%\nSP = 500 × (100 + 20) / 100 = 500 × 1.2 = ₹600\n\n**6. Finding SP from CP and Loss%:**\nSP = CP × (100 - Loss%) / 100\n\nExample: CP = ₹400, Loss% = 10%\nSP = 400 × (100 - 10) / 100 = 400 × 0.9 = ₹360\n\n**7. Finding CP from SP and Profit%:**\nCP = SP × 100 / (100 + Profit%)\n\n**8. Finding CP from SP and Loss%:**\nCP = SP × 100 / (100 - Loss%)\n\n**Important:** Profit% and Loss% are always calculated on Cost Price (CP) unless stated otherwise.",

Find profit%.\n\nProfit = SP - CP = 750 - 600 = ₹150\nProfit% = (Profit / CP) × 100\n= (150 / 600) × 100\n= 25%\n\n**Example 2: Finding Loss%**\nAn article bought for ₹800 is sold for ₹640. Find loss%.\n\nLoss = CP - SP = 800 - 640 = ₹160\nLoss% = (Loss / CP) × 100\n= (160 / 800) × 100\n= 20%\n\n**Example 3: Finding SP when CP and Profit% given**\nCP = ₹1200, Profit% = 15%.
