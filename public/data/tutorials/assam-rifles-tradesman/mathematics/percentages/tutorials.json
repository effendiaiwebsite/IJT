      "content": "Percentage is one of the most important and frequently asked topics in Assam Rifles Tradesman exam. It forms the basis for many other topics like profit-loss, simple interest, and data interpretation.\n\n**What is Percentage?**\nPercentage means 'per hundred' or 'out of 100'. The symbol % represents percentage.\n\n**Why Important?**\n- Used in profit-loss calculations\n- Essential for simple and compound interest\n- Required in data interpretation\n- Applied in daily life (discounts, taxes, etc.)\n- 10-15% questions directly or indirectly based on percentages\n\n**Basic Concept:**\n50% means 50 out of 100 = 50/100 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\n**Real-life Examples:**\n- If you scored 80 marks out of 100, you got 80%\n- A 20% discount on ₹500 item = ₹100 discount\n- If 30% students are girls in a class of 100 = 30 girls\n\nMastering percentages is crucial as it appears directly in 4-5 questions and indirectly in many more.",
