      "content": "**Step-by-Step Method:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Relation**\nQuestion: \"A is B's father. C is B's son. How is A related to C?\"\n\nSolution:\n- A is B's father\n- C is B's son\n- If A is B's father and C is B's son, then A is C's grandfather\n\nAnswer: Grandfather\n\n**Example 2: Using Diagram**\nQuestion: \"Pointing to a woman, Ram said, 'She is the daughter of my grandfather's only child.' How is the woman related to Ram?\"\n\nSolution:\n- My grandfather's only child = My father or mother\n- That person's daughter = My sister\n\nAnswer: Sister\n\n**Example 3: Multiple Steps**\nQuestion: \"A is B's brother. C is A's mother. D is C's father. How is B related to D?\"\n\nSolution:\nDiagram:\n```\nD (Grandfather)\n|\nC (Mother)\n|\nA — B (Siblings)\n```\n- D is C's father\n- C is A's mother\n- A is B's brother\n- Therefore, D is B's grandfather\n\nAnswer: Granddaughter/Grandson (depending on B's gender)\n\n**Example 4: Indirect Relation**\nQuestion: \"Introducing a man, a woman said, 'He is the only son of my mother's mother.'

Use different symbols for male and female.",

How is A related to D?\"\n\nSolution:\n- A, B, C are sisters\n- E is B's daughter\n- D is E's brother\n- Since A and B are sisters, A is E's aunt\n- D is E's brother, so D is also B's son\n- Therefore, A is D's aunt\n\nAnswer: Aunt\n\n**Example 2:**\n\"P is Q's brother. R is Q's mother. S is R's father. How is P related to S?\"\n\nSolution:\n```\nS (Great Grandfather)\n|\nR (Grandmother)\n|\nQ — P (Siblings)\n```\nAnswer: Great Grandson\n\n**Coded Blood Relations:**\n\nSometimes relations are coded:\n\n**Example 3:**\n\"If A + B means A is the mother of B\nA - B means A is the brother of B\nA × B means A is the father of B\nA ÷ B means A is the daughter of B\n\nWhat does P + Q - R mean?\"\n\nSolution:\n- P + Q: P is mother of Q\n- Q - R: Q is brother of R\n- So P is mother of both Q and R\n- Relationship between P and R: Mother\n\n**Mixed Gender Problems:**\n\n**Example 4:**\n\"In a family of 6, there are two married couples. A is grandmother of D and mother of B. C is wife of B and mother of E. How is E related to A?\"\n\nSolution:\n- A is grandmother of D and mother of B\n- C is wife of B\n- C is mother of E\n- Therefore: A is B's mother, B is E's father\n- So A is E's grandmother\n\nAnswer: Granddaughter/Grandson",

      "content": "**Quick Solving Techniques:**\n\n**1. Start with the reference person:**\nAlways identify who \"I\" or \"my\" refers to in the question.\n\n**2. Use standard symbols:**\n- Male: Triangle or Plus\n- Female: Circle\n- Marriage: Horizontal line connecting two symbols\n- Children: Vertical lines going down\n\n**3. Common phrases and their meanings:**\n- \"Only son\" → There are no other sons\n- \"Only daughter\" → There are no other daughters\n- \"Only child\" → There are no siblings\n\n**4. Reverse tracking:**\nWhen asked \"How is X related to Y?\", work backwards from Y.\n\n**5. Gender clues:**\nSome words automatically tell gender:\n- \"His/He\" → Male\n- \"Her/She\" → Female\n- Be careful with neutral terms\n\n**6. Generational counting:**\nCount vertical steps in family tree:\n- 0 steps = Same generation (sibling, cousin, spouse)\n- 1 step = Parent or child\n- 2 steps = Grandparent or grandchild\n\n**7. Common mistakes to avoid:**\n- Confusing uncle with grandfather\n- Mixing up in-law relations\n- Not considering gender when required\n- Assuming relationships not clearly stated\n\n**8. Time management:**\n- Draw quick diagram (max 30 seconds)\n- Trace relationship (30 seconds)\n- Select answer and move on\n- Don't spend more than 1-1.5 minutes\n\n**Practice Strategy:**\n- Solve 10-15 questions daily\n- Focus on drawing clear diagrams\n- Memorize common relationship patterns\n- Time yourself while practicing",
