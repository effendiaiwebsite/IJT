      "title": "Introduction to Time and Distance",
      "content": "Time and Distance is a practical and important topic for RPSF Constable exam. It deals with the relationship between distance traveled, time taken, and speed of motion.\n\n**Basic Concept:**\nThe three quantities - Distance, Speed, and Time - are related by:\n**Distance = Speed × Time**\n\n**Key Terms:**\n\n**Distance:** Length of path traveled (km, m, miles)\n**Speed:** Rate of motion (km/h, m/s, miles/h)\n**Time:** Duration of journey (hours, minutes, seconds)\n**Average Speed:** Total distance / Total time\n\n**Units of Speed:**\n- km/h (kilometers per hour)\n- m/s (meters per second)\n- km/min (kilometers per minute)\n\n**Conversion:**\n- 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s\n- 1 m/s = 18/5 km/h = 3.6 km/h\n\n**Why Important?**\n- 2-3 guaranteed questions in exam\n- Very practical topic (trains, buses, cars)\n- Used in relative speed problems\n- Essential for understanding motion\n\n**Real-Life Applications:**\n- Planning travel time\n- Calculating fuel consumption\n- Train/bus timing\n- Racing and sports\n\nThis topic requires strong formula knowledge and unit conversion skills.",

      "content": "**Three Basic Formulas:**\n\n**1. Distance = Speed × Time**\nD = S × T\n\n**2. Speed = Distance / Time**\nS = D / T\n\n**3. Time = Distance / Speed**\nT = D / S\n\n**Example 1:**\nSpeed = 60 km/h, Time = 3 hours, Find Distance\nD = 60 × 3 = 180 km\n\n**Example 2:**\nDistance = 240 km, Time = 4 hours, Find Speed\nS = 240 / 4 = 60 km/h\n\n**Example 3:**\nDistance = 150 km, Speed = 50 km/h, Find Time\nT = 150 / 50 = 3 hours\n\n**Unit Conversions:**\n\n**km/h to m/s:**\nMultiply by 5/18\nExample: 72 km/h = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s\n\n**m/s to km/h:**\nMultiply by 18/5\nExample: 15 m/s = 15 × 18/5 = 54 km/h\n\n**km to m:** Multiply by 1000\n**m to km:** Divide by 1000\n**hours to minutes:** Multiply by 60\n**minutes to hours:** Divide by 60\n**hours to seconds:** Multiply by 3600\n\n**Quick Conversions to Remember:**\n- 36 km/h = 10 m/s\n- 54 km/h = 15 m/s\n- 72 km/h = 20 m/s\n- 90 km/h = 25 m/s\n- 108 km/h = 30 m/s",

      "title": "Average Speed",
      "content": "**Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time**\n\n**Important:** Average speed ≠ Average of speeds\n\n**Example 1: Same Distance at Different Speeds**\nA person travels 100 km at 50 km/h and returns 100 km at 40 km/h. Find average speed.\n\n**Wrong Method:** (50 + 40)/2 = 45 km/h ✗\n\n**Correct Method:**\nTime for onward journey = 100/50 = 2 hours\nTime for return journey = 100/40 = 2.5 hours\nTotal distance = 200 km\nTotal time = 4.5 hours\nAverage speed = 200/4.5 = 44.44 km/h ✓\n\n**Formula for Equal Distances:**\nIf distance d is covered at speed v₁ and same distance at v₂:\nAverage Speed = (2 × v₁ × v₂) / (v₁ + v₂)\n\nExample: 50 km/h and 40 km/h\n= (2 × 50 × 40) / (50 + 40)\n= 4000 / 90 = 44.44 km/h ✓\n\n**Example 2: Different Distances**\nA travels 60 km at 30 km/h and 90 km at 45 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nTime₁ = 60/30 = 2 hours\nTime₂ = 90/45 = 2 hours\nTotal distance = 150 km\nTotal time = 4 hours\nAverage speed = 150/4 = 37.5 km/h\n\n**Remember:** Always calculate total distance and total time separately, then find average speed.",
