      "title": "Introduction to Active and Passive Voice",
      "content": "Voice in grammar refers to the relationship between the subject and the verb in a sentence. Understanding active and passive voice is essential for clear communication and scoring well in SSC MTS.\n\nWhat is Voice:\n- Voice shows whether the subject performs or receives the action\n- Two types: Active Voice and Passive Voice\n\nActive Voice:\n- Subject performs the action\n- Structure: Subject + Verb + Object\n- Example: Ram writes a letter.\n  (Ram = subject doing the action)\n\nPassive Voice:\n- Subject receives the action\n- Structure: Object + is/was/been + Past Participle (by + Subject)\n- Example: A letter is written by Ram.\n  (Letter = subject receiving the action)\n\nWhy Learn Voice:\n1. Common question type in SSC MTS\n2. Improves sentence construction skills\n3. Essential for formal writing\n4. Tests understanding of verb forms\n5. Helps in error detection questions\n\nWhen to Use Each Voice:\n\nActive Voice (preferred):\n- Direct and clear communication\n- When doer is important\n- Informal writing and speaking\n- Example: The teacher explained the lesson.\n\nPassive Voice:\n- When action is more important than doer\n- When doer is unknown or obvious\n- Formal and scientific writing\n- Example: The lesson was explained.\n\nKey Components:\n- Subject: Who/what does the action\n- Verb: The action\n- Object: Who/what receives the action\n- By + Agent: Who does the action in passive (often optional)\n\nFor SSC MTS, focus on:\n- Converting between active and passive\n- Identifying voice in sentences\n- Choosing correct passive form for different tenses"

      "content": "Converting voice in present tenses:\n\n1. SIMPLE PRESENT:\n\nActive: Subject + V1(s/es) + Object\nPassive: Object + is/am/are + V3 + by + Subject\n\nExamples:\n- Active: Ram writes a letter.\n- Passive: A letter is written by Ram.\n\n- Active: She teaches English.\n- Passive: English is taught by her.\n\n- Active: They play cricket.\n- Passive: Cricket is played by them.\n\nNote: Use 'is' with singular objects, 'are' with plural objects\n\n2. PRESENT CONTINUOUS:\n\nActive: Subject + is/am/are + V1+ing + Object\nPassive: Object + is/am/are + being + V3 + by + Subject\n\nExamples:\n- Active: Ram is writing a letter.\n- Passive: A letter is being written by Ram.\n\n- Active: She is teaching English.\n- Passive: English is being taught by her.\n\n- Active: They are playing cricket.\n- Passive: Cricket is being played by them.\n\n3. PRESENT PERFECT:\n\nActive: Subject + has/have + V3 + Object\nPassive: Object + has/have + been + V3 + by + Subject\n\nExamples:\n- Active: Ram has written a letter.\n- Passive: A letter has been written by Ram.\n\n- Active: She has taught English.\n- Passive: English has been taught by her.\n\n- Active: They have played cricket.\n- Passive: Cricket has been played by them.\n\nNote: Use 'has' with singular objects, 'have' with plural objects\n\n4. PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS:\n\nNote: This tense is rarely converted to passive voice as it sounds awkward.\n\nImportant Points:\n- Object of active sentence becomes subject of passive\n- Subject of active sentence becomes 'by + agent' in passive\n- Main verb changes to past participle (V3)\n- Helping verbs change according to tense\n- 'By + agent' can be omitted if not important"

      "title": "Verbs That Cannot Be Passive",
      "content": "Certain verbs cannot be used in passive voice:\n\n1. INTRANSITIVE VERBS (No Object):\n\nVerbs that don't take an object cannot be passive.\n\nExamples:\n- He sleeps. (No passive)\n- She laughed. (No passive)\n- They arrived. (No passive)\n- The sun rises. (No passive)\n\nReason: Passive voice needs an object to become the subject\n\n2. STATIVE VERBS:\n\nVerbs expressing state rather than action rarely take passive.\n\n- Resemble: She resembles her mother. (No passive)\n- Have (possession): I have a car. (No passive)\n- Lack: He lacks confidence. (No passive)\n- Suit: This dress suits you. (No passive)\n- Become: He became a doctor. (No passive)\n- Consist of: Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen. (No passive)\n\n3. VERB + PREPOSITION (Some cases):\n\n- Agree with: I agree with you. (No passive)\n- Belong to: This book belongs to me. (No passive)\n- Consist of: The team consists of 11 players. (No passive)\n\nBut some can be passive:\n- Look after: She looks after children. → Children are looked after by her.\n- Laugh at: They laughed at him. → He was laughed at by them.\n\n4. VERBS IN CONTINUOUS TENSES (Some):\n\nPresent Perfect Continuous and Past Perfect Continuous are rarely made passive.\n\nActive: He has been writing a book.\nPassive: (Awkward and rarely used)\n\n5. WHEN 'BY + AGENT' IS OBVIOUS:\n\nSometimes passive is used without 'by + agent':\n- English is spoken here. (by people - obvious)\n- The room was cleaned. (by someone - not important)\n- The bridge was built in 1980. (by workers - obvious)\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Not all active sentences can be converted to passive\n- Check if the verb takes an object\n- Some sentences sound awkward in passive\n- Choose voice based on what you want to emphasize"

      "content": "Complete strategy for mastering voice for SSC MTS:\n\n1. Identification Strategy:\n\nActive Voice Indicators:\n- Subject performs action\n- Subject comes first\n- Direct object present\n- Structure: Subject + Verb + Object\n\nPassive Voice Indicators:\n- Subject receives action\n- Form of 'be' + past participle (V3)\n- 'By' often present (but not always)\n- Structure: Subject + be + V3 + by + Object\n\n2. Conversion Steps:\n\nActive to Passive:\nStep 1: Identify Subject, Verb, Object\nStep 2: Make Object the new Subject\nStep 3: Identify tense of verb\nStep 4: Use appropriate form of 'be' + V3\nStep 5: Add 'by + old subject' (if needed)\nStep 6: Keep other parts (time, place) unchanged\n\nPassive to Active:\nStep 1: Identify the 'by + agent' (if present)\nStep 2: Make agent the new Subject\nStep 3: Identify tense from 'be' form\nStep 4: Convert V3 to appropriate tense form\nStep 5: Make old subject the Object\n\n3. Quick Reference:\n\nTense → Passive Form:\n- Simple Present: is/am/are + V3\n- Present Continuous: is/am/are + being + V3\n- Present Perfect: has/have + been + V3\n- Simple Past: was/were + V3\n- Past Continuous: was/were + being + V3\n- Past Perfect: had + been + V3\n- Simple Future: will + be + V3\n- Future Perfect: will + have + been + V3\n- Modals: Modal + be + V3\n\n4. Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n- Wrong helping verb for tense\n- Forgetting to change main verb to V3\n- Using 'by' with every passive (not always needed)\n- Converting intransitive verbs\n- Changing tense while converting\n\n5. Practice Plan:\n\nWeek 1-2: Learn all tense conversions\n- Focus on present and past tenses\n- Practice 10 conversions daily\n\nWeek 3-4: Learn modal and special cases\n- Questions, commands\n- Double object sentences\n- Practice 15 conversions daily\n\nWeek 5-6: Mixed practice\n- Identify voice in sentences\n- Convert both ways (active↔passive)\n- Solve previous year questions\n\nWeek 7-8: Speed practice\n- Time yourself (30 seconds per question)\n- Take mock tests\n- Review all errors\n\n6. Exam Tips:\n- Read the entire sentence carefully\n- Identify the tense first\n- Check if verb can be passive\n- Eliminate wrong options\n- Verify your answer by converting back\n- Don't change the meaning or tense\n\n7. Memory Tricks:\n- Passive always uses V3 (past participle)\n- If you see 'being', it's continuous passive\n- If you see 'been', it's perfect passive\n- 'By' is a clue but not mandatory\n- Modal + be = passive modal\n\nConsistent practice is key to mastering voice conversion!"
