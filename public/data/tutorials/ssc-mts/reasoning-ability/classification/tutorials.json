    {"id": "slide-1", "slideNumber": 1, "type": "content", "title": "Introduction to Classification", "content": "Classification is the process of grouping items based on common properties or characteristics. In reasoning exams, classification questions test your ability to identify the odd one out - the item that doesn't belong to the group.\n\nFormat: You are given 4-5 items, and you must identify which one is different from the others.\n\nTypes of Classification:\n1. Number Classification - Based on mathematical properties\n2. Letter Classification - Based on alphabetical patterns\n3. Word Classification - Based on meanings and categories\n4. Figure Classification - Based on visual patterns\n\nThe key skill is identifying what makes three items similar and one different. This tests your observation, pattern recognition, and analytical thinking."},
    {"id": "slide-2", "slideNumber": 2, "type": "content", "title": "Number Classification - Basic Concepts", "content": "In number classification, identify the number that doesn't follow the same pattern or property as others.\n\nCommon Number Properties:\n\n1. Even/Odd Numbers:\nExample: 2, 4, 6, 9\nOdd one: 9 (only odd number among even numbers)\n\n2. Prime/Composite:\nExample: 3, 5, 7, 9\nOdd one: 9 (only composite among primes)\n\n3. Perfect Squares:\nExample: 4, 9, 16, 20\nOdd one: 20 (not a perfect square)\n\n4. Perfect Cubes:\nExample: 8, 27, 64, 100\nOdd one: 100 (not a perfect cube)\n\n5. Multiples:\nExample: 10, 15, 20, 22\nOdd one: 22 (not a multiple of 5)\n\nStrategy: Check each number for common properties - even/odd, prime, perfect square/cube, divisibility, etc."},
    {"id": "slide-3", "slideNumber": 3, "type": "question", "title": "Practice Question", "question": {"questionText": "Find the odd one: 2, 3, 5, 9", "options": ["2", "3", "5", "9"], "correctAnswer": 3, "explanation": "2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. 9 is composite (3×3), so it's the odd one out."}},
    {"id": "slide-4", "slideNumber": 4, "type": "content", "title": "Number Classification - Patterns", "content": "Sometimes numbers are classified based on patterns or relationships rather than individual properties.\n\n1. Arithmetic Sequence:\nExample: 5, 10, 15, 22\nPattern: +5, +5, +7\nOdd one: 22 (breaks the +5 pattern, should be 20)\n\n2. Geometric Sequence:\nExample: 2, 4, 8, 15\nPattern: ×2, ×2, (should be ×2)\nOdd one: 15 (should be 16)\n\n3. Sum of Digits:\nExample: 12, 21, 30, 45\nDigit sums: 3, 3, 3, 9\nOdd one: 45 (digit sum is 9, not 3)\n\n4. Number of Digits:\nExample: 12, 45, 67, 123\nOdd one: 123 (three digits, others have two)\n\n5. Special Numbers:\nExample: 11, 22, 33, 45\nOdd one: 45 (not a repeated digit number)\n\nTip: Look for patterns in differences, ratios, digit properties, or special characteristics."},
    {"id": "slide-5", "slideNumber": 5, "type": "content", "title": "Letter Classification", "content": "Letter classification identifies the letter that doesn't fit the pattern based on alphabetical positions or properties.\n\n1. Vowels/Consonants:\nExample: A, E, I, K\nOdd one: K (only consonant among vowels)\n\n2. Positional Pattern:\nExample: B, D, F, I\nPositions: 2, 4, 6, 9\nOdd one: I (position 9, breaks even number pattern)\n\n3. Letter Sequence:\nExample: A, C, E, H\nPattern: +2, +2, +3\nOdd one: H (should be G for +2 pattern)\n\n4. Symmetrical Letters:\nExample: A, H, M, N\nOdd one: N (not vertically symmetrical like others)\n\n5. Letter Shape:\nExample: C, O, S, X\nOdd one: X (has intersection, others are curved)\n\nStrategy: Check position numbers, vowel/consonant, alphabetical gaps, and letter shapes."},

J (10) breaks the pattern - should be H (8)."}},
    {"id": "slide-7", "slideNumber": 7, "type": "content", "title": "Word Classification - Categories", "content": "Word classification requires identifying the word that doesn't belong to the same category as others.\n\n1. Animal Classification:\nExample: Dog, Cat, Lion, Rose\nOdd one: Rose (flower, others are animals)\n\n2. Color Classification:\nExample: Red, Blue, Green, Chair\nOdd one: Chair (not a color)\n\n3. Vehicle Classification:\nExample: Car, Bus, Train, Table\nOdd one: Table (furniture, not a vehicle)\n\n4. Body Parts:\nExample: Eye, Ear, Nose, Book\nOdd one: Book (not a body part)\n\n5. Professions:\nExample: Doctor, Teacher, Engineer, Mango\nOdd one: Mango (fruit, not a profession)\n\n6. Food Items:\nExample: Rice, Wheat, Milk, Pen\nOdd one: Pen (stationery, not food)\n\nStrategy: Identify the common category for three items, then spot the one that doesn't fit."},
    {"id": "slide-8", "slideNumber": 8, "type": "content", "title": "Word Classification - Relationships", "content": "Sometimes classification is based on relationships, properties, or characteristics rather than simple categories.\n\n1. Gender:\nExample: King, Prince, Emperor, Queen\nOdd one: Queen (female, others male)\n\n2. Size/Degree:\nExample: Tiny, Small, Little, Huge\nOdd one: Huge (large size, others indicate smallness)\n\n3. Natural/Man-made:\nExample: Mountain, River, Tree, Building\nOdd one: Building (man-made, others natural)\n\n4. Living/Non-living:\nExample: Dog, Tree, Man, Stone\nOdd one: Stone (non-living, others living)\n\n5. Function:\nExample: Hammer, Saw, Drill, Apple\nOdd one: Apple (food, others are tools)\n\n6. Material:\nExample: Wood, Iron, Steel, Honesty\nOdd one: Honesty (abstract quality, others are materials)\n\nTip: Think about meaning, function, origin, size, gender, or any other distinguishing feature."},

Potato is a vegetable, so it's the odd one out."}},
    {"id": "slide-10", "slideNumber": 10, "type": "content", "title": "Mixed Classification Types", "content": "Some questions combine multiple classification types or require deeper analysis.\n\n1. Number-Letter Mix:\nExample: 2B, 4D, 6F, 7G\nPattern: Even numbers with even-positioned letters\nOdd one: 7G (7 is odd)\n\n2. Synonym Groups:\nExample: Happy, Joyful, Cheerful, Sad\nOdd one: Sad (antonym, others are synonyms)\n\n3. Capital-Country:\nExample: Delhi-India, Paris-France, London-England, Apple-Fruit\nOdd one: Apple-Fruit (not capital-country pair)\n\n4. Abbreviations:\nExample: USA, UK, UAE, INDIA\nOdd one: INDIA (full name, others are abbreviations)\n\n5. Plural Forms:\nExample: Books, Pens, Tables, Child\nOdd one: Child (singular, others plural)\n\nStrategy: Look for the most obvious difference first, then check for subtle patterns."},
    {"id": "slide-11", "slideNumber": 11, "type": "content", "title": "Tips for Solving Classification", "content": "Master Strategies:\n\n1. Systematic Approach:\n- Read all options carefully\n- Identify common property of 3 items\n- Check which one differs\n- Verify your answer\n\n2. For Numbers:\n- Check: even/odd, prime/composite, perfect squares/cubes\n- Look for patterns: +n, ×n, alternating\n- Examine digit properties: sum, product\n- Consider divisibility rules\n\n3. For Letters:\n- Write position numbers (A=1, B=2...)\n- Check vowel/consonant\n- Look for gaps between letters\n- Consider letter shapes\n\n4. For Words:\n- Identify the category (animal, plant, color, etc.)\n- Check relationships (synonym, antonym)\n- Consider properties (size, gender, nature)\n- Think about function or use\n\n5. Common Mistakes:\n- Rushing without checking all options\n- Missing subtle patterns\n- Confusing similar concepts\n- Not verifying the answer\n\nPractice Tip: Solve 15-20 classification questions daily to improve speed and accuracy."}
