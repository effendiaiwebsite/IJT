Understanding basic physics concepts helps explain everyday phenomena.\n\nMotion:\n- Change in position of an object with time\n- Types: Linear (straight line), Circular, Rotational\n- Speed: Distance covered per unit time (km/h, m/s)\n- Velocity: Speed with direction\n- Acceleration: Rate of change of velocity\n\nNewton's Laws of Motion:\n\n1. First Law (Law of Inertia):\n- Object at rest stays at rest, object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by external force\n- Example: Passenger jerks forward when bus suddenly stops\n- Inertia: Tendency to resist change in state of motion\n\n2. Second Law:\n- Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma)\n- Greater mass needs greater force to accelerate\n- Example: Difficult to push a loaded truck than empty truck\n\n3. Third Law:\n- Every action has equal and opposite reaction\n- Example: Rocket propulsion, recoil of gun, swimming\n\nForce:\n- Push or pull that changes or tends to change state of motion\n- Unit: Newton (N)\n- Types: Gravitational, Frictional, Magnetic, Electrostatic\n\nGravity:\n- Force of attraction between objects\n- Earth's gravity pulls objects downward\n- Weight = Mass × Gravity (W = mg)\n- g = 9.8 m/s² on Earth\n\nFriction:\n- Force opposing motion between surfaces\n- Useful: Walking, writing, brakes\n- Reduced by: Lubrication, polishing, ball bearings"
