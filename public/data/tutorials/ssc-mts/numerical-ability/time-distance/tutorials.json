      "title": "Introduction to Time and Distance",
      "content": "Time and Distance is a crucial topic in SSC MTS exam that deals with the relationship between the distance traveled, the time taken, and the speed of travel. This concept applies to various real-life scenarios like vehicles traveling, people walking, trains passing platforms, boats moving in rivers, etc.\n\nUnderstanding Time and Distance helps you solve problems related to journeys, relative speed, average speed, and more. These questions are very common in competitive exams and are usually straightforward if you understand the basic formulas and concepts.\n\nIn this chapter, we will cover Speed-Distance-Time relationship, Average Speed, Relative Speed, Problems on Trains, Boats and Streams, and various tricks to solve questions quickly. Mastering these concepts will help you score well in the numerical ability section of SSC MTS."

      "content": "The fundamental relationship between Speed, Distance, and Time is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nDistance = Speed × Time\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nRemember this triangle:\n       D\n      / \\\n     S × T\n\nWhere D = Distance, S = Speed, T = Time\n\nUnits:\n- Distance: kilometers (km), meters (m)\n- Time: hours (h), minutes (min), seconds (sec)\n- Speed: km/h, m/s\n\nUnit Conversions (Very Important!):\n- To convert km/h to m/s: multiply by 5/18\n- To convert m/s to km/h: multiply by 18/5\n\nExample: 36 km/h = 36 × (5/18) = 10 m/s\nExample: 15 m/s = 15 × (18/5) = 54 km/h\n\nBasic Examples:\n1. A car travels 180 km in 3 hours. Speed = 180/3 = 60 km/h\n2. A train runs at 90 km/h for 2 hours. Distance = 90 × 2 = 180 km\n3. A bus covers 240 km at 60 km/h. Time = 240/60 = 4 hours"

      "content": "Average Speed is the total distance traveled divided by total time taken. It is NOT the simple average of speeds!\n\nFormula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nCase 1: Different distances at different speeds\nAverage Speed = (D₁ + D₂) / (T₁ + T₂)\nWhere T₁ = D₁/S₁ and T₂ = D₂/S₂\n\nCase 2: Equal distances at different speeds\nIf a person travels distance D at speed S₁ and returns the same distance at speed S₂:\nAverage Speed = 2S₁S₂ / (S₁ + S₂)\n\nThis is the Harmonic Mean formula - very important!\n\nExample: A person goes from A to B at 60 km/h and returns at 40 km/h. Find average speed.\nAverage Speed = (2 × 60 × 40) / (60 + 40) = 4800 / 100 = 48 km/h\nNote: It's NOT (60+40)/2 = 50 km/h!\n\nCase 3: Equal time at different speeds\nAverage Speed = (S₁ + S₂) / 2 (Simple arithmetic mean)\n\nExample: A person travels for 2 hours at 30 km/h and 2 hours at 50 km/h.\nAverage Speed = (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 km/h"

Time to cross = ?\nTotal distance = 100 + 150 = 250 m\nRelative speed = 45 + 36 = 81 km/h = 81 × (5/18) = 22.5 m/s\nTime = 250 / 22.5 = 11.11 seconds"

Find speed.\nTotal distance = 200 + 300 = 500m\nSpeed = 500 / 25 = 20 m/s = 72 km/h\n\nCase 3: Train crossing another stationary train\nTime = (Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2) / Speed of Train 1\n\nExample: A 150m train passes a 100m stationary train in 10 seconds.\nSpeed = (150 + 100) / 10 = 25 m/s = 90 km/h"

If a person covers distances D₁, D₂, D₃ at speeds S₁, S₂, S₃:\n   Average Speed = (D₁ + D₂ + D₃) / (D₁/S₁ + D₂/S₂ + D₃/S₃)\n\n4. For three equal parts of journey at speeds S₁, S₂, S₃:\n   Average Speed = 3 / (1/S₁ + 1/S₂ + 1/S₃)\n\n5. Time saved = Original Time - New Time\n\n6. Remember: Distance = Speed × Time (write this triangle in exam)\n\n7. Always check units - convert km/h to m/s when dealing with meters\n\n8. In boat problems, downstream is always faster than upstream\n\nPractice is key! Solve as many problems as possible to master Time and Distance for your SSC MTS exam."
