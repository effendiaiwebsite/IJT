      "title": "Introduction to Simple Interest",
      "content": "Simple Interest is a fundamental concept in banking and finance that is extensively tested in SSC MTS exams. When you borrow money from a bank or lend money to someone, you pay or receive extra money along with the original amount. This extra money is called Interest.\n\nSimple Interest is the interest calculated only on the original principal amount (the initial sum of money) for the entire time period. It does not take into account any interest earned on previously accumulated interest, which makes it 'simple' to calculate.\n\nIn real life, Simple Interest is used in various situations like bank deposits, loans, investments, and financial planning. Understanding Simple Interest helps you make better financial decisions and solve mathematical problems quickly in competitive exams. The concept involves three main components: Principal (P), Rate of Interest (R), and Time (T), which together determine the Simple Interest (SI) earned or paid."

      "title": "Basic Terms and Formula",
      "content": "Let's understand the key terms used in Simple Interest:\n\nPrincipal (P): The original sum of money borrowed or invested. It is also called the capital.\n\nRate of Interest (R): The percentage at which interest is calculated on the principal per year. It is usually expressed as % per annum (p.a.).\n\nTime (T): The duration for which the money is borrowed or invested, usually expressed in years.\n\nSimple Interest (SI): The extra money paid or earned on the principal for the given time period.\n\nAmount (A): The total money to be returned or received at the end, which includes both principal and interest. Amount = Principal + Simple Interest\n\nThe Basic Formula for Simple Interest:\nSI = (P × R × T) ÷ 100\n\nWhere:\n- SI = Simple Interest\n- P = Principal\n- R = Rate of interest per annum\n- T = Time in years\n\nThis is the most important formula you need to remember. All questions are based on this fundamental formula."

        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Using the formula SI = (P × R × T) ÷ 100 = (5000 × 10 × 2) ÷ 100 = 100000 ÷ 100 = Rs. 1000."

      "content": "From the basic formula SI = (P × R × T) ÷ 100, we can derive formulas to find any variable when the other three are known. These derived formulas are very useful in solving different types of problems:\n\n1. To find Principal (P):\nP = (SI × 100) ÷ (R × T)\n\n2. To find Rate (R):\nR = (SI × 100) ÷ (P × T)\n\n3. To find Time (T):\nT = (SI × 100) ÷ (P × R)\n\n4. To find Amount (A):\nA = P + SI\nOr directly: A = P + (P × R × T) ÷ 100 = P[1 + (R × T) ÷ 100]\n\n5. To find Principal when Amount is given:\nP = (A × 100) ÷ [100 + (R × T)]\n\nExample: If SI = Rs. 600, Rate = 5% p.a., Time = 3 years, find Principal.\nP = (600 × 100) ÷ (5 × 3) = 60000 ÷ 15 = Rs. 4000\n\nRemember: Always ensure that time is in years and rate is per annum before applying formulas."

      "title": "Time Conversion",
      "content": "In Simple Interest problems, it is crucial to convert time into years because the rate is usually given per annum (per year). Here are the important conversions:\n\nMonths to Years:\nTime in years = Number of months ÷ 12\nExample: 6 months = 6 ÷ 12 = 0.5 years or 1/2 year\nExample: 18 months = 18 ÷ 12 = 1.5 years or 3/2 years\n\nDays to Years:\nTime in years = Number of days ÷ 365\nExample: 73 days = 73 ÷ 365 = 0.2 years or 1/5 year\nExample: 146 days = 146 ÷ 365 = 0.4 years or 2/5 years\n\nFor exact calculations, some problems use 360 days in a year (commercial year).\n\nMixed Time Periods:\nIf time is given as \"2 years and 6 months\", convert to: 2 + 6/12 = 2.5 years\nIf time is given as \"1 year 8 months\", convert to: 1 + 8/12 = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3 years\n\nQuick Tip: For SSC MTS, it's often easier to work with fractions rather than decimals to avoid calculation errors."

        "correctAnswer": 3,
        "explanation": "Let amount at 10% = x, then amount at 8% = (10000 - x). Total SI = (x × 10 × 1)/100 + ((10000-x) × 8 × 1)/100 = 920. Simplifying: 10x/100 + 80000/100 - 8x/100 = 920. So, 2x/100 = 920 - 800 = 120. Therefore, 2x = 12000, x = Rs. 6000."

      "title": "Important Tips and Shortcuts",
      "content": "Here are some important tips and shortcuts for solving Simple Interest problems quickly in SSC MTS exams:\n\n1. When Same SI from Different Sources:\nIf SI from two investments is same, then P₁R₁T₁ = P₂R₂T₂\n\n2. When SI is Same as Principal:\nR × T = 100 (This happens when amount becomes double)\n\n3. Quick Percentage Calculations:\nFor 5% of any amount, multiply by 0.05 or divide by 20\nFor 10% of any amount, divide by 10\nFor 12.5% (1/8) of any amount, divide by 8\nFor 20% of any amount, divide by 5\n\n4. Working with Fractions:\nInstead of using decimals, work with fractions for exact answers\nExample: 6 months = 1/2 year, 4 months = 1/3 year\n\n5. Common Patterns to Remember:\n- 100 ÷ 5 = 20 (for 5%, money doubles in 20 years)\n- 100 ÷ 10 = 10 (for 10%, money doubles in 10 years)\n- 100 ÷ 20 = 5 (for 20%, money doubles in 5 years)\n\n6. Check Your Units:\nAlways ensure P is in rupees, R is in % p.a., and T is in years before calculation.\n\nPractice regularly to increase your speed and accuracy!"
