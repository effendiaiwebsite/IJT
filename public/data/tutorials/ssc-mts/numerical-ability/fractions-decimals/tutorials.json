      "content": "A fraction represents a part of a whole or a division of one quantity by another. It is written in the form a/b, where 'a' is called the numerator and 'b' is called the denominator. The numerator represents the number of parts we have, while the denominator represents the total number of equal parts.\n\nFor example, in the fraction 3/4, the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 4. This means we have 3 parts out of 4 equal parts. The denominator can never be zero because division by zero is undefined.\n\nFractions are essential in everyday life - from dividing a pizza among friends to calculating cooking measurements, understanding discounts, and solving various mathematical problems in competitive exams like SSC MTS."

      "content": "There are several types of fractions:\n\n1. Proper Fraction: Numerator is less than denominator (e.g., 3/5, 2/7, 11/15). The value is always less than 1.\n\n2. Improper Fraction: Numerator is greater than or equal to denominator (e.g., 7/5, 9/4, 8/8). The value is always greater than or equal to 1.\n\n3. Mixed Fraction: Combination of a whole number and a proper fraction (e.g., 2 1/3, 5 2/7). It represents a value greater than 1.\n\n4. Unit Fraction: Numerator is 1 (e.g., 1/2, 1/5, 1/10). These are the simplest fractions.\n\n5. Like Fractions: Fractions with the same denominator (e.g., 2/7, 3/7, 5/7).\n\n6. Unlike Fractions: Fractions with different denominators (e.g., 1/2, 2/3, 3/5)."

        "explanation": "An improper fraction has a numerator greater than or equal to the denominator. In 7/4, the numerator 7 is greater than the denominator 4, making it an improper fraction. All other options have numerators smaller than denominators, making them proper fractions."

      "content": "Converting Improper Fraction to Mixed Fraction:\nDivide the numerator by the denominator. The quotient becomes the whole number, the remainder becomes the new numerator, and the denominator remains the same.\nExample: 17/5 → 17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2, so 17/5 = 3 2/5\n\nConverting Mixed Fraction to Improper Fraction:\nMultiply the whole number by the denominator, add the numerator, and place the result over the original denominator.\nFormula: a b/c = (a × c + b)/c\nExample: 3 2/5 → (3 × 5 + 2)/5 = 17/5\n\nSimplifying Fractions:\nDivide both numerator and denominator by their HCF to get the fraction in its lowest terms.\nExample: 12/18 → HCF(12, 18) = 6, so 12/18 = (12÷6)/(18÷6) = 2/3"
