      "content": "Data Interpretation (DI) is the process of analyzing, reviewing, and drawing conclusions from given data presented in various formats like tables, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs. This skill is essential in SSC MTS exams and real-life decision making.\n\nData Interpretation questions test your ability to quickly read and understand data, perform calculations, identify trends, compare values, and make logical conclusions. These questions are usually based on practical scenarios like sales data, population statistics, budget allocation, exam results, etc.\n\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to read and interpret different types of data representations. We'll cover Tables, Bar Charts (vertical and horizontal), Pie Charts, and Line Graphs. The key to mastering DI is practice - the more you work with different types of data, the faster and more accurate you'll become."

      "title": "Reading and Interpreting Tables",
      "content": "Tables are the simplest form of data representation, showing data in rows and columns. They are easy to read but require careful attention to detail.\n\nHow to Read Tables:\n1. Identify the title - tells you what data is shown\n2. Read column headers - categories or variables\n3. Read row headers - items or time periods\n4. Locate specific data points at row-column intersections\n5. Note units and whether percentages or absolute values are shown\n\nExample Table: Monthly Sales (in thousands ₹)\nMonth    | Product A | Product B | Product C\nJanuary  | 50        | 30        | 40\nFebruary | 60        | 35        | 45\nMarch    | 55        | 40        | 50\n\nCommon Questions:\n- Total/Sum: Add all values in a row or column\n- Average: Sum divided by number of items\n- Maximum/Minimum: Highest/Lowest value\n- Difference: Subtract two values\n- Percentage: (Part/Whole) × 100\n- Ratio: Compare two values\n\nTips:\n- Underline or mark important data\n- Do mental calculations when possible\n- Check units (thousands, lakhs, etc.)\n- Verify your calculations"

      "title": "Bar Charts - Basics",
      "content": "Bar Charts use rectangular bars to represent data. The length or height of bars is proportional to the values they represent. Bar charts make it easy to compare different categories visually.\n\nTypes of Bar Charts:\n1. Vertical Bar Chart: Bars rise upward from horizontal axis\n2. Horizontal Bar Chart: Bars extend right from vertical axis\n3. Grouped Bar Chart: Multiple bars for each category (comparing sub-categories)\n4. Stacked Bar Chart: Bars stacked on top of each other (showing parts of whole)\n\nHow to Read Bar Charts:\n1. Read the title to understand what data is shown\n2. Check the axis labels and scale\n3. Note the legend (if multiple categories are shown)\n4. Compare bar heights/lengths to determine values\n5. Use gridlines to estimate values accurately\n\nExample: If a bar reaches the 50 mark on the y-axis, the value is 50.\nIf it's between 40 and 50, estimate (e.g., 45).\n\nAdvantages:\n- Easy visual comparison\n- Clear representation of differences\n- Good for categorical data\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid:\n- Not reading the scale correctly\n- Missing the units (hundreds, thousands, etc.)\n- Confusing stacked vs grouped bars"

      "title": "Pie Charts",
      "content": "Pie Charts (or Circle Charts) show data as slices of a circle, where each slice represents a proportion of the whole. The entire circle represents 100% or the total value.\n\nKey Concepts:\n- Total circle = 360° = 100%\n- Each slice angle is proportional to its value\n- Larger slice = larger value/percentage\n\nFormulas:\nValue of a slice = (Angle/360°) × Total Value\nAngle of a slice = (Value/Total Value) × 360°\nPercentage = (Angle/360°) × 100%\n\nExample: Total budget = ₹10,000\nEducation slice = 90°\nEducation budget = (90/360) × 10,000 = ₹2,500\nEducation percentage = (90/360) × 100 = 25%\n\nHow to Read Pie Charts:\n1. Check if values, percentages, or angles are given\n2. Find the total (if not given, calculate from percentages)\n3. Calculate individual values from angles or percentages\n4. Compare slice sizes visually\n5. Check if percentages add up to 100%\n\nTips:\n- Largest slice is usually easy to spot\n- Two equal slices have same angle\n- Quarter circle = 90° = 25%\n- Half circle = 180° = 50%"

      "content": "Line Graphs show data as points connected by straight lines, usually to display trends or changes over time. They are excellent for showing continuous data and identifying patterns.\n\nComponents:\n- X-axis (horizontal): Usually represents time (months, years, days)\n- Y-axis (vertical): Represents the measured quantity (sales, temperature, population)\n- Data points: Marked at intersections\n- Lines: Connect consecutive data points\n\nTypes of Trends:\n1. Increasing: Line slopes upward (values rising)\n2. Decreasing: Line slopes downward (values falling)\n3. Constant: Horizontal line (no change)\n4. Fluctuating: Line goes up and down (varying values)\n\nHow to Read Line Graphs:\n1. Identify what each axis represents\n2. Note the scale and intervals\n3. Locate data points for specific time periods\n4. Observe overall trends (rising, falling, stable)\n5. Identify maximum and minimum points\n6. Calculate differences between points\n\nCommon Questions:\n- Maximum/Minimum value and when it occurred\n- Increase/Decrease between two periods\n- Average over a time period\n- Trend analysis (which period showed growth?)\n\nMultiple Line Graphs: Show comparison between 2-3 categories over time using different colored or styled lines."
