      "content": "A ratio is a comparison of two quantities of the same kind expressed in the same units. It shows how many times one value contains or is contained within the other. The ratio of a to b is written as a:b and is read as 'a is to b'.\n\nFor example, if there are 3 boys and 5 girls in a group, the ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. This means for every 3 boys, there are 5 girls. The total number of students is 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nKey Points:\n- Both quantities must be in the same units before comparing\n- The order matters: 3:5 is different from 5:3\n- Ratios can be simplified like fractions by dividing by common factors\n- A ratio has no units\n\nExample: The ratio 6:9 can be simplified to 2:3 by dividing both by 3."

Compound Ratio: Ratio of product of antecedents to product of consequents of two or more ratios.\nExample: Compound ratio of 2:3 and 4:5 = (2×4):(3×5) = 8:15\n\n3. Duplicate Ratio: Square of the given ratio.\nExample: Duplicate ratio of 3:4 = 3²:4² = 9:16\n\n4. Triplicate Ratio: Cube of the given ratio.\nExample: Triplicate ratio of 2:3 = 2³:3³ = 8:27\n\n5. Sub-duplicate Ratio: Square root of the given ratio.\nExample: Sub-duplicate ratio of 16:25 = √16:√25 = 4:5\n\n6. Inverse Ratio: Reciprocal of the given ratio.\nExample: Inverse ratio of 3:5 = 5:3"

If a:b = b:c, then a, b, c are in continued proportion, and b² = ac\n\n5. Conversion between Ratio and Fraction:\n   Ratio 3:5 can be written as fraction 3/5\n\n6. Adding or subtracting the same value to both terms changes the ratio:\n   3:4 ≠ (3+2):(4+2) = 5:6"
