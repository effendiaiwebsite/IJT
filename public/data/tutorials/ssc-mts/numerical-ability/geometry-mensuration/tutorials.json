      "title": "Introduction to Geometry and Mensuration",
      "content": "Geometry deals with shapes, sizes, positions, and properties of figures, while Mensuration focuses on calculating measurements like length, area, perimeter, volume, and surface area of geometric figures. These topics are essential for SSC MTS exams and have practical applications in everyday life.\n\nIn this chapter, we will cover basic geometric concepts including lines, angles, triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles. We will also learn mensuration formulas for calculating perimeter, area, volume, and surface area of various 2D and 3D shapes.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts will help you solve problems related to construction, land measurement, packaging, and many other real-world scenarios. Mastering the formulas and their applications is key to scoring well in this section."
