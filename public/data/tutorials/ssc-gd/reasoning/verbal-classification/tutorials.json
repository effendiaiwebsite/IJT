      "content": "Classification involves grouping similar items together and identifying which item doesn't belong to a group.\n\nWhat is Classification?\nClassification questions test your ability to identify common properties among items and spot the odd one out. You need to find the logic that connects most items and identify which item doesn't follow that logic.\n\nWhy Classification is Important:\n- Tests pattern recognition\n- Evaluates categorization skills\n- Commonly asked in SSC GD (2-3 questions)\n- Builds analytical thinking\n- Essential for logical reasoning\n\nTypes of Classification:\n1. Verbal Classification - Words and meanings\n2. Number Classification - Numerical patterns\n3. Letter Classification - Alphabetical patterns\n4. Figure Classification - Visual patterns\n5. Mixed Classification - Combinations\n\nKey Skills Required:\n- Pattern identification\n- Categorization ability\n- Vocabulary knowledge\n- Logical reasoning\n- Attention to detail\n- Quick analysis\n\nBasic Approach:\n1. Examine all given items\n2. Find common property among 3-4 items\n3. Identify which item doesn't share that property\n4. Verify your answer\n5. Choose the odd one out\n\nGeneral Principle:\nIn a set of 4-5 items, typically 3-4 items share a common property and 1 item is different. Your task is to identify the different one."

      "content": "Verbal classification involves finding odd words based on meaning, category, or relationship.\n\nTypes of Verbal Classification:\n\n1. Category-Based:\nItems from same category vs different category\n\nExample: Lion, Tiger, Elephant, Dog\nAnalysis: Lion, Tiger, Elephant are wild animals. Dog is domestic.\nOdd one: Dog\n\n2. Relationship-Based:\nSimilar relationships vs different\n\nExample: Father-Son, Mother-Daughter, Brother-Sister, Teacher-Student\nAnalysis: First three are family relations. Last is not.\nOdd one: Teacher-Student\n\n3. Function-Based:\nSimilar purpose vs different\n\nExample: Pen, Pencil, Eraser, Chalk\nAnalysis: Pen, Pencil, Chalk are for writing. Eraser removes writing.\nOdd one: Eraser\n\n4. Nature-Based:\nInherent properties\n\nExample: Gold, Silver, Copper, Steel\nAnalysis: Gold, Silver, Copper are pure metals. Steel is an alloy.\nOdd one: Steel\n\n5. Size/Magnitude:\nComparative sizes\n\nExample: Kilometer, Meter, Centimeter, Liter\nAnalysis: First three are distance units. Liter is volume.\nOdd one: Liter\n\nCommon Classification Patterns:\n\n1. Living vs Non-living:\nExample: Tree, Plant, Flower, Stone\nOdd one: Stone (non-living)\n\n2. Natural vs Artificial:\nExample: Mountain, River, Lake, Bridge\nOdd one: Bridge (man-made)\n\n3. Edible vs Non-edible:\nExample: Apple, Banana, Mango, Wood\nOdd one: Wood (not edible)\n\n4. Animal Categories:\nExample: Cow, Buffalo, Goat, Lion\nOdd one: Lion (carnivore, others herbivore)\n\n5. Occupation:\nExample: Doctor, Teacher, Engineer, Hospital\nOdd one: Hospital (place, not occupation)\n\n6. Parts of Whole:\nExample: Wheel, Engine, Brake, Road\nOdd one: Road (not part of vehicle)\n\n7. Tools and Instruments:\nExample: Hammer, Screwdriver, Pliers, Nail\nOdd one: Nail (not a tool)\n\n8. Subject Categories:\nExample: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Cricket\nOdd one: Cricket (sport, not science subject)\n\nSolving Strategy:\n\nStep 1: Read All Words\nUnderstand meaning of each word\n\nStep 2: Group Similar Ones\nFind what 3 words have in common\n\nStep 3: Identify Different One\nWhich word doesn't fit the group\n\nStep 4: Verify\nConfirm the classification logic\n\nExample Problem:\nWords: Rose, Jasmine, Lotus, Mango\n\nStep 1: All are plants\nStep 2: Rose, Jasmine, Lotus are flowers\nStep 3: Mango is a fruit tree, not a flower\nStep 4: Odd one is Mango\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n- Not considering all possible groupings\n- Focusing on superficial similarities\n- Missing the dominant pattern\n- Overthinking simple classifications"

      "title": "Mixed Classification Strategies",
      "content": "Mixed classification combines multiple types and requires flexible thinking.\n\nComplex Classification Patterns:\n\n1. Multi-Property Classification:\nItems may differ in multiple ways\nIdentify the most significant difference\n\nExample: Words - Cow, Horse, Dog, Table\nDifferences:\n- Living vs non-living\n- Animal vs object\nPrimary: Table (non-living, others living)\n\n2. Hierarchical Classification:\nCategories within categories\n\nExample: Sparrow, Pigeon, Crow, Bat\nAll fly, but:\n- Sparrow, Pigeon, Crow are birds\n- Bat is a mammal\nOdd one: Bat\n\n3. Dual Classification:\nTwo valid groupings possible\nChoose based on options\n\nExample: 2, 4, 6, 9\nGrouping 1: Even numbers (2,4,6) vs Odd (9)\nGrouping 2: Single digit all\nPrimary classification: Even vs Odd\nOdd one: 9\n\n4. Exception-Based:\nGeneral rule with exception\n\nExample: January, March, May, June, August\nAll months, but:\n- Jan, Mar, May, Aug have 31 days\n- June has 30 days\nOdd one: June\n\n5. Function and Form:\nClassify by use or appearance\n\nExample: Knife, Spoon, Fork, Plate\nKnife, Spoon, Fork: Eating utensils\nPlate: Serving item\nOdd one: Plate\n\nAdvanced Strategies:\n\nStrategy 1: Elimination Method\n\nStep 1: Find what ANY 3 have in common\nStep 2: Check if 4th fits\nStep 3: If not, that's the odd one\nStep 4: If yes, try different grouping\n\nStrategy 2: Property Matrix\n\nCreate mental checklist:\n□ Category (animal, plant, object)\n□ Size (large, small)\n□ Color (if relevant)\n□ Function (what it does)\n□ Origin (natural, artificial)\n□ Material (metal, wood, etc.)\n\nMark properties for each item\nFind the unique one\n\nStrategy 3: Opposite Property\n\nSometimes odd one has opposite property\n- If 3 are solid, 1 is liquid\n- If 3 are hot, 1 is cold\n- If 3 are living, 1 is non-living\n\nStrategy 4: Magnitude Classification\n\nFor numbers or measurable items:\nExample: 1000, 2000, 3000, 500\nPattern: Thousands except 500\nOdd one: 500\n\nCombined Example:\n\nItems: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon\n\nAnalysis:\nAll celestial bodies\nBut:\n- Mercury, Venus, Earth are planets\n- Moon is a satellite\n\nOdd one: Moon\n\nAlternative analysis:\n- All in solar system\n- Mercury, Venus, Moon have no atmosphere\n- Earth has atmosphere\n\nBoth valid, but first is more fundamental\n\nCommon Traps:\n\n1. Superficial Similarity:\nDon't group just because items sound similar\nExample: Bat (animal), Bat (cricket)\n\n2. Over-specification:\nDon't create too narrow categories\nExample: All are fruits\nDon't subdivide into citrus/non-citrus unless needed\n\n3. Under-specification:\nDon't miss obvious categories\nExample: Tiger, Lion, Leopard, Cow\nAll animals, but obvious: first 3 are carnivores\n\n4. Multiple Valid Answers:\nIf exam, one is more fundamental\nChoose the most obvious classification\n\nPractice Approach:\n\n1. Verbal: Build vocabulary, know categories\n2. Number: Memorize primes, squares, cubes\n3. Letter: Know positions, patterns\n4. Figure: Practice visual recognition\n5. Mixed: Combine all skills\n\nTime Management:\n\n- Classification questions: 30-45 seconds each\n- Quick pattern recognition\n- Don't overthink\n- First clear grouping usually correct"
