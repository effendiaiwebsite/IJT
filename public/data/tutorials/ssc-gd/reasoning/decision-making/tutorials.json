      "content": "Rule-based decision making involves applying given criteria or rules to determine the correct course of action.\n\nUnderstanding Rule-Based Questions:\nYou'll be given a set of rules or conditions, and you need to decide which option follows those rules correctly.\n\nExample 1: Admission Criteria\nRules for college admission:\n- Age: 17-25 years\n- Minimum 60% in 12th\n- No backlogs in previous exams\n\nCandidate: Age 22, 65% marks, no backlogs\nDecision: ELIGIBLE (meets all criteria)\n\nCandidate: Age 16, 70% marks, no backlogs\nDecision: NOT ELIGIBLE (below minimum age)\n\nExample 2: Leave Approval\nRules for leave approval:\n- Maximum 3 days casual leave per month\n- Must apply 2 days in advance\n- No leave on first and last day of month\n\nScenario: Employee wants leave on 5th, applied today (3rd)\nDecision: APPROVED (meets all conditions)\n\nScenario: Employee wants leave on 1st, applied in advance\nDecision: NOT APPROVED (cannot take leave on 1st)\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\nStep 1: List all given rules\n- Write down each condition clearly\n- Note any exceptions\n\nStep 2: Check each rule against scenario\n- Go through rules one by one\n- Mark which are satisfied\n- Identify any violations\n\nStep 3: Make decision\n- All rules satisfied → Approve\n- Any rule violated → Reject\n- Note which rule was violated\n\nExample 3: Promotion Eligibility\nRules:\n1. Minimum 5 years service\n2. Good performance rating\n3. No disciplinary action in last 2 years\n4. Passed departmental exam\n\nCandidate A: 6 years service, excellent rating, no action, passed exam\nDecision: ELIGIBLE ✓\n\nCandidate B: 7 years service, good rating, warning 1 year ago, passed exam\nDecision: NOT ELIGIBLE ✗ (had disciplinary action)\n\nCommon Question Formats:\n- Who is eligible/not eligible?\n- Which application should be approved?\n- Who meets the criteria?\n- What action should be taken?\n\nTips for Rule-Based Questions:\n1. Read all rules twice\n2. Check each rule systematically\n3. Don't skip any condition\n4. One violation = disqualification\n5. Be careful with numbers and dates\n6. Watch for words like 'minimum', 'maximum', 'at least'"

      "content": "Situational decision making requires you to choose the best course of action in a given scenario based on practical judgment and common sense.\n\nKey Principles:\n\n1. Safety First:\nIn emergencies, prioritize safety of people\nExample: During fire, evacuate people before saving property\n\n2. Follow Protocol:\nAdhere to rules and procedures\nExample: Report to superior before taking major action\n\n3. Majority Benefit:\nChoose option that helps most people\nExample: Delay one person's work to help emergency case\n\n4. Ethical Conduct:\nMaintain honesty and integrity\nExample: Report wrongdoing even if it affects colleague\n\n5. Practical Solution:\nChoose feasible and realistic options\nExample: Use available resources effectively\n\nExample Scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Medical Emergency\nSituation: You're on duty. A person collapses nearby.\nOptions:\nA) Complete your current work first\nB) Call for medical help immediately\nC) Ignore as it's not your responsibility\nD) Take a break\n\nBest Answer: B (Medical emergency requires immediate action)\n\nScenario 2: Rule Violation\nSituation: Your friend breaks a rule at work.\nOptions:\nA) Ignore to protect your friend\nB) Report to supervisor\nC) Cover up the mistake\nD) Threaten your friend\n\nBest Answer: B (Duty requires reporting violations)\n\nScenario 3: Priority Conflict\nSituation: Boss gives urgent task, but you have scheduled meeting.\nOptions:\nA) Skip the meeting without informing\nB) Ignore boss's request\nC) Inform meeting participants and prioritize urgent task\nD) Do both simultaneously\n\nBest Answer: C (Balance both by proper communication)\n\nScenario 4: Resource Shortage\nSituation: Two people need help, but you can help only one immediately.\nOptions:\nA) Help the first person who asked\nB) Help based on severity of need\nC) Help neither to avoid bias\nD) Let them decide who gets help\n\nBest Answer: B (Prioritize based on urgency and need)\n\nDecision Making Framework:\n\n1. Assess Situation:\n- What is the problem?\n- How urgent is it?\n- Who is affected?\n\n2. Consider Options:\n- What are possible actions?\n- What are consequences of each?\n- Which aligns with rules/ethics?\n\n3. Choose Best Option:\n- Prioritize safety and rules\n- Consider practical feasibility\n- Think about long-term impact\n\n4.

      "content": "Priority setting involves deciding the order in which tasks should be completed based on urgency and importance.\n\nUrgent vs Important:\n\nUrgent: Needs immediate attention\nImportant: Has significant impact\n\nPriority Matrix:\n1. Urgent + Important: Do First\n2. Important but Not Urgent: Schedule\n3. Urgent but Not Important: Delegate if possible\n4. Neither: Do Last or Eliminate\n\nExample 1: Police Duty Scenario\nYou receive multiple calls:\nA) Road accident with injuries\nB) Noise complaint from neighbor\nC) Lost pet report\nD) Scheduled patrol duty\n\nPriority Order:\n1. A (Urgent + Important: Life threat)\n2. D (Important: Scheduled duty)\n3. B (Less urgent: Minor issue)\n4. C (Least urgent: Not life-threatening)\n\nExample 2: Office Work\nTasks for today:\nA) Boss needs report by 5 PM (deadline today)\nB) Colleague needs file (can wait till tomorrow)\nC) System backup (scheduled weekly task)\nD) Emergency equipment check\n\nPriority Order:\n1. D (Emergency-related, urgent)\n2. A (Deadline today)\n3. C (Scheduled task)\n4. B (Can be postponed)\n\nExample 3: Multiple Emergencies\nThree situations occur simultaneously:\nA) Fire alarm in building\nB) Important client call\nC) Boss wants to see you\n\nBest Action: A (Safety first, evacuate)\nThen handle B and C after ensuring safety\n\nFactors to Consider:\n\n1. Safety Impact:\n- Life-threatening situations get highest priority\n- Property damage comes next\n- Minor inconveniences last\n\n2. Time Sensitivity:\n- Deadlines that cannot be extended\n- Time-bound opportunities\n- Tasks that block others' work\n\n3. Impact Magnitude:\n- Number of people affected\n- Severity of consequences\n- Long-term implications\n\n4. Resource Availability:\n- Can it be done now?\n- Do you have required resources?\n- Can someone else do it?\n\n5. Rules and Regulations:\n- Mandatory compliance tasks\n- Legal requirements\n- Policy adherence\n\nPractical Tips:\n\n1. In Doubt, Ask:\n- Clarify priorities with supervisor\n- Don't assume importance\n\n2. Communicate:\n- Inform people about delays\n- Explain priority decisions\n\n3. Be Flexible:\n- Priorities can change\n- Adapt to new situations\n\n4. Document:\n- Keep record of decisions\n- Note reasons for priorities\n\nExample 4: Study Time Management\nExam in 2 days, multiple subjects:\nA) Strong subject, 1 chapter left\nB) Weak subject, 3 chapters left\nC) Average subject, 2 chapters left\nD) Revision of completed topics\n\nRecommended Priority:\n1. B (Weak subject needs more time)\n2. C (Average subject, moderate effort)\n3. D (Revision for retention)\n4. A (Already strong, less time needed)"
