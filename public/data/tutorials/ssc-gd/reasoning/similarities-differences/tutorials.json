      "title": "Introduction to Similarities and Differences",
      "content": "Similarities and Differences questions test your ability to identify patterns, relationships, and odd items within a group. This topic is crucial for developing analytical and observational skills.\n\nWhat is Classification?\nClassification means grouping items based on common properties. In reasoning, you need to identify which item doesn't belong to a group or find items that share similar characteristics.\n\nTypes of Questions:\n1. Find the Odd One Out - Identify the different item in a group\n2. Classification - Group items based on common properties\n3. Similarities - Find common features among items\n4. Differences - Identify distinguishing features\n\nWhy Important for SSC GD:\n- Tests logical thinking and pattern recognition\n- 2-4 questions typically appear in the exam\n- Builds observation skills\n- Improves decision-making ability\n\nCommon Classification Categories:\n1. Numbers (even/odd, prime, perfect square)\n2. Letters (vowels/consonants, position-based)\n3. Words (category, meaning, spelling pattern)\n4. Objects (function, type, characteristics)\n\nBasic Approach:\n1. Observe all items carefully\n2. Find common properties\n3. Identify the different one\n4. Verify your answer\n\nExample:\nFind the odd one: 2, 4, 6, 9\nAnalysis: 2, 4, 6 are even numbers; 9 is odd\nAnswer: 9 is the odd one out\n\nKey Skills Required:\n- Pattern recognition\n- Logical reasoning\n- Quick observation\n- Knowledge of basic categories\n- Elimination technique"

Perfect Cubes:\n- Cubes: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216\n- Example: Find odd one: 8, 27, 30, 64\n  Answer: 30 (not a perfect cube)\n\n5. Divisibility Rules:\n- Divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18\n- Divisible by 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\n- Example: Find odd one: 10, 15, 20, 23, 25\n  Answer: 23 (not divisible by 5)\n\n6. Number of Digits:\n- Single digit: 1-9\n- Double digit: 10-99\n- Example: Find odd one: 12, 15, 18, 5\n  Answer: 5 (single digit, others are double)\n\n7. Sum of Digits:\n- Example: 12(1+2=3), 21(2+1=3), 30(3+0=3), 14(1+4=5)\n- Answer: 14 (sum is 5, others have sum 3)\n\nSolving Strategy:\n1. Check if all are even/odd\n2. Check for prime numbers\n3. Check for perfect squares/cubes\n4. Check divisibility patterns\n5. Check digit-based patterns\n6. Use elimination method"
