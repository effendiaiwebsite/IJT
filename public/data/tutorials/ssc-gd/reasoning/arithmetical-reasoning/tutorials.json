      "content": "Age problems involve finding the ages of people based on given relationships between their ages.\n\nBasic Age Problem Structure:\n\nPresent Age: Current age\nPast Age: Age some years ago (Present - years)\nFuture Age: Age after some years (Present + years)\n\nCommon Age Problem Types:\n\n1. Present Age Problems:\nFind current ages based on given conditions\n\nExample: The sum of ages of A and B is 50. A is 10 years older than B. Find their ages.\n\nSolution:\nLet B's age = x\nThen A's age = x + 10\nSum: x + (x + 10) = 50\n2x + 10 = 50\n2x = 40\nx = 20\n\nB = 20 years, A = 30 years\n\n2. Ratio of Ages:\nAges given in ratio form\n\nExample: Ages of A and B are in ratio 3:5. Sum of their ages is 80. Find A's age.\n\nSolution:\nLet ages be 3x and 5x\n3x + 5x = 80\n8x = 80\nx = 10\n\nA's age = 3x = 30 years\n\n3. Past and Future Age:\nRelating past, present, and future ages\n\nExample: 5 years ago, A was 3 times as old as B. After 5 years, A will be twice as old as B. Find present ages.\n\nSolution:\nLet present ages be A = a, B = b\n\n5 years ago: a - 5 = 3(b - 5)\na - 5 = 3b - 15\na = 3b - 10 ... (equation 1)\n\nAfter 5 years: a + 5 = 2(b + 5)\na + 5 = 2b + 10\na = 2b + 5 ... (equation 2)\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2:\n3b - 10 = 2b + 5\nb = 15\n\nFrom equation 2: a = 2(15) + 5 = 35\n\nPresent ages: A = 35, B = 15\n\n4. Age Difference:\nDifference between ages remains constant\n\nExample: A is 5 years older than B. 10 years ago, A was twice as old as B. Find present ages.\n\nSolution:\nLet B's present age = x\nThen A's present age = x + 5\n\n10 years ago:\nA's age = x + 5 - 10 = x - 5\nB's age = x - 10\n\nGiven: x - 5 = 2(x - 10)\nx - 5 = 2x - 20\nx = 15\n\nPresent ages: B = 15, A = 20\n\n5. Average Age:\nProblems involving average of ages\n\nExample: Average age of 4 people is 30. If one person aged 40 leaves, what is new average?\n\nSolution:\nTotal age of 4 people = 4 × 30 = 120\nAfter 40 leaves: 120 - 40 = 80\nNew average = 80 ÷ 3 = 26.67 years\n\nKey Formulas:\n\n1. If present age is x:\n- Age n years ago = x - n\n- Age after n years = x + n\n\n2. Age difference never changes:\n- If A is n years older than B now\n- A was n years older in past\n- A will be n years older in future\n\n3. Ratio of ages:\n- If ratio is a:b and sum is S\n- First age = (a/(a+b)) × S\n- Second age = (b/(a+b)) × S\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n- Confusing past and future ages\n- Forgetting that age difference is constant\n- Sign errors in equations\n- Not verifying answer with original conditions"

      "title": "Average Problems",
      "content": "Average problems involve finding the mean of a set of numbers or working with averages.\n\nBasic Average Formula:\nAverage = Sum of all values / Number of values\n\nTypes of Average Problems:\n\n1. Finding Average:\nGiven numbers, find average\n\nExample: Find average of 10, 20, 30, 40.\n\nSolution:\nAverage = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40) / 4 = 100 / 4 = 25\n\n2. Finding Missing Number:\nAverage and some numbers given\n\nExample: Average of 5 numbers is 20. Four numbers are 10, 15, 25, 30. Find the fifth.\n\nSolution:\nSum of 5 numbers = 5 × 20 = 100\nSum of 4 numbers = 10 + 15 + 25 + 30 = 80\nFifth number = 100 - 80 = 20\n\n3. Change in Average:\nWhen elements are added or removed\n\nExample: Average of 10 numbers is 50. One number 60 is replaced by 40. Find new average.\n\nSolution:\nOriginal sum = 10 × 50 = 500\nNew sum = 500 - 60 + 40 = 480\nNew average = 480 / 10 = 48\n\n4. Combined Average:\nAverages of different groups\n\nExample: Average of 5 numbers is 20, average of 3 numbers is 30. Find overall average.\n\nSolution:\nSum of first group = 5 × 20 = 100\nSum of second group = 3 × 30 = 90\nTotal sum = 100 + 90 = 190\nTotal numbers = 5 + 3 = 8\nOverall average = 190 / 8 = 23.75\n\n5. Weighted Average:\nDifferent weights for different values\n\nExample: A student scores 70 in test 1 (weight 40%), 80 in test 2 (weight 60%). Find weighted average.\n\nSolution:\nWeighted average = (70 × 0.4) + (80 × 0.6)\n= 28 + 48 = 76\n\n6. Average Speed:\nTotal distance / Total time\n\nExample: A person travels 60 km at 30 km/hr and returns at 20 km/hr. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nTime for journey 1 = 60/30 = 2 hours\nTime for journey 2 = 60/20 = 3 hours\nTotal distance = 60 + 60 = 120 km\nTotal time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours\nAverage speed = 120/5 = 24 km/hr\n\n7. Average Age:\nSimilar to other averages\n\nExample: Average age of 4 people is 25. One person aged 30 leaves. Find new average.\n\nSolution:\nTotal age = 4 × 25 = 100\nNew total = 100 - 30 = 70\nNew average = 70/3 = 23.33 years\n\nImportant Formulas:\n\n1. Sum = Average × Number of items\n\n2. New average when element added:\nNew Avg = (Old Sum + New Element) / (n + 1)\n\n3. New average when element removed:\nNew Avg = (Old Sum - Removed Element) / (n - 1)\n\n4. Average of first n natural numbers:\nAverage = (n + 1) / 2\n\n5. Average of first n even numbers:\nAverage = n + 1\n\n6. Average of first n odd numbers:\nAverage = n\n\nSpecial Cases:\n\n1. Average of consecutive numbers:\nAverage = (First + Last) / 2\n\nExample: Average of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n= (5 + 9) / 2 = 7\n\n2. Average remains same:\nIf you add x and subtract x, average unchanged\n\n3. Symmetric distribution:\nIn symmetric set, average = middle value\n\nTricks:\n\n1. For consecutive numbers:\nJust find middle number (if odd count)\nOr average of two middle numbers (if even count)\n\n2. Deviation method:\nFind deviation from assumed average\nActual average = Assumed average + (Sum of deviations / n)\n\n3. Quick check:\nAverage should be between minimum and maximum values"

      "content": "Calendar and clock problems test understanding of time, dates, and angles.\n\nCalendar Problems:\n\n1. Odd Days Concept:\nOdd days = Remaining days after complete weeks\n\nOrdinary year = 365 days = 52 weeks + 1 day (1 odd day)\nLeap year = 366 days = 52 weeks + 2 days (2 odd days)\n\n2. Day of the Week:\nFinding what day a date falls on\n\nKey Facts:\n- Every 400 years, pattern repeats\n- January 1, 2000 was Saturday\n- Use odd days to find day\n\n3. Leap Year Rules:\nDivisible by 4 → Leap year\nExcept: Century years (divisible by 400)\n\nExamples:\n2024 → Leap (divisible by 4)\n1900 → Not leap (century, not divisible by 400)\n2000 → Leap (divisible by 400)\n\n4. Counting Days:\nDays between two dates\n\nExample: Days from Jan 15 to March 10 (same year, non-leap)\nJan: 31 - 15 = 16 days remaining\nFeb: 28 days\nMarch: 10 days\nTotal = 16 + 28 + 10 = 54 days\n\n5. Same Day Problems:\nWhen will same day occur\n\nExample: If today is Monday, what day after 100 days?\nSolution:\n100 ÷ 7 = 14 weeks + 2 days\n2 days after Monday = Wednesday\n\nClock Problems:\n\n1. Angle Between Hands:\nAt any time, angle between hour and minute hands\n\nFormula:\nAngle = |30H - 5.5M|\nWhere H = hour, M = minutes\n\nIf angle > 180°, actual angle = 360° - calculated angle\n\nExample: Find angle at 3:15\nAngle = |30(3) - 5.5(15)|\n= |90 - 82.5|\n= 7.5°\n\n2. When Hands Coincide:\nHour and minute hands overlap\n\nThey coincide 11 times in 12 hours\nEvery 12/11 hours = approximately 65.45 minutes\n\n3. Hands at Right Angle:\nWhen hands form 90°\n\nFormula: 30H - 5.5M = ±90\n\n4. Hands Opposite:\nWhen hands form 180°\n\nFormula: 30H - 5.5M = 180\n\n5. Speed of Hands:\nMinute hand: 6° per minute\nHour hand: 0.5° per minute\n\nRelative speed = 5.5° per minute\n\n6. Mirror Time:\nReflected clock time\n\nFormula: Mirror time = 11:60 - Actual time\n\nExample: Actual time 3:20\nMirror time = 11:60 - 3:20 = 8:40\n\n7. Gaining/Losing Time:\nClock running fast or slow\n\nExample: Clock gains 5 minutes per hour. After 3 hours, what time does it show if started at 12:00?\n\nActual time passed = 3 hours\nClock shows = 3 hours + 3(5 min) = 3 hours 15 min\nTime shown = 3:15\n\nCalendar Formulas:\n\n1. Odd days in n years:\n= n ordinary years + leap years in period\n= n + (n/4) [approximately]\n\n2. Day after n days:\nFind n mod 7 = remainder\nCount that many days forward\n\n3. Same calendar year:\nAfter 28 years (for non-century years)\nCentury years: varies\n\nClock Formulas:\n\n1. Angle between hands:\nAngle = |11M/2 - 30H|\n\n2. Time when hands coincide:\nt = (12/11) × hour\n\n3. Times hands are perpendicular:\nOccurs 22 times in 12 hours\n\nQuick Tricks:\n\n1. Century leap years:\nOnly 2000, 2400, 2800 are leap\n1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 are not\n\n2. Same day after 7 days:\nAlways same day of week\n\n3. Clock at 3:00:\nAngle = 90° (always)\n\n4.

Increase and Decrease:\nFinding final value after percentage changes\n\nExample: Price increased by 20%, then decreased by 20%. What is net change?\n\nSolution:\nLet original price = 100\nAfter 20% increase = 120\nAfter 20% decrease on 120 = 120 - 24 = 96\nNet change = 96 - 100 = -4%\nAnswer: 4% decrease\n\n2. Population Growth:\nYear-on-year percentage growth\n\nExample: Population grows 10% per year. If current population is 10000, what after 2 years?\n\nSolution:\nAfter 1 year = 10000 × 1.10 = 11000\nAfter 2 years = 11000 × 1.10 = 12100\n\nOr: 10000 × (1.10)² = 12100\n\n3. Consumption-Expenditure:\nPrice and consumption relationship\n\nExample: Price increases 25%. By what % should consumption decrease to keep expenditure same?\n\nSolution:\nLet original price = 100, consumption = 100\nExpenditure = 100 × 100 = 10000\n\nNew price = 125\nFor same expenditure: 125 × new consumption = 10000\nNew consumption = 80\n\nDecrease = 100 - 80 = 20%\n\nFormula: Decrease % = (Increase %) / (100 + Increase %) × 100\n= 25/125 × 100 = 20%\n\n4. Passing Marks:\nMinimum percentage to pass\n\nExample: Student scores 30% and fails by 20 marks. Another scores 40% and passes by 10 marks. Find passing marks.\n\nSolution:\nLet maximum marks = M\n30% of M + 20 = Passing marks\n40% of M - 10 = Passing marks\n\n0.3M + 20 = 0.4M - 10\n30 = 0.1M\nM = 300\n\nPassing marks = 0.3(300) + 20 = 110\n\n5. Salary and Savings:\nIncome-expenditure problems\n\nExample: A's salary is 20% more than B's. B's salary is 80% of C's. If C earns ₹5000, what does A earn?\n\nSolution:\nC = 5000\nB = 80% of 5000 = 4000\nA = 120% of 4000 = 4800\n\nRatio Reasoning Problems:\n\n1. Mixture Problems:\nCombining substances in ratios\n\nExample: Milk and water in ratio 4:1. If mixture is 50 liters, how much water?\n\nSolution:\nTotal parts = 4 + 1 = 5\nWater = (1/5) × 50 = 10 liters\n\n2. Partnership:\nSharing profit in ratio of investments\n\nExample: A invests ₹3000, B invests ₹5000. Profit is ₹4000. Find A's share.\n\nSolution:\nRatio = 3000:5000 = 3:5\nTotal parts = 8\nA's share = (3/8) × 4000 = ₹1500\n\n3. Age Ratio:\nCurrent and future age ratios\n\nExample: Present ages in ratio 3:5. After 10 years, ratio will be 2:3. Find present ages.\n\nSolution:\nLet present ages = 3x and 5x\nAfter 10 years: (3x+10):(5x+10) = 2:3\n\n3(3x+10) = 2(5x+10)\n9x + 30 = 10x + 20\nx = 10\n\nPresent ages = 30 and 50\n\n4. Proportion:\na:b = c:d means a×d = b×c\n\nExample: If 3:x = x:12, find x.\n\nSolution:\n3 × 12 = x × x\n36 = x²\nx = 6\n\n5. Compound Ratio:\nMultiply ratios\n\nExample: If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:B:C\n\nSolution:\nMake B common:\nA:B = 8:12 (multiply by 4)\nB:C = 12:15 (multiply by 3)\nA:B:C = 8:12:15\n\nKey Formulas:\n\nPercentage:\n1. x% of y = (x/100) × y\n2. Percentage increase = (Increase/Original) × 100\n3. Successive changes: If a% then b%\n   Net = a + b + (ab/100)\n\nRatio:\n1. If ratio a:b and sum S\n   First = (a/(a+b)) × S\n   Second = (b/(a+b)) × S\n\n2.

In how many days can B alone complete?\n\nSolution:\nA's 3 days work = 3/10\nRemaining work = 1 - 3/10 = 7/10\nB does 7/10 work in 14 days\nB's 1 day work = (7/10)/14 = 1/20\nB alone can complete in 20 days\n\n3. Alternate Day Work:\nA and B working on alternate days\n\nExample: A can do work in 6 days, B in 8 days. If they work alternate days (A starts), in how many days will work complete?\n\nSolution:\nA's 1 day work = 1/6\nB's 1 day work = 1/8\n\nIn 2 days (one day each):\nWork = 1/6 + 1/8 = 4/24 + 3/24 = 7/24\n\nFor 3 cycles (6 days): 3 × 7/24 = 21/24\nRemaining = 3/24 = 1/8\nOn 7th day, A works: 1/6 (more than 1/8 needed)\n\nSo work completes on 7th day\n\n4. Efficiency Ratio:\nWork ratio problems\n\nExample: A is twice as efficient as B. Together they complete work in 10 days. How long would B take alone?\n\nSolution:\nLet B's efficiency = 1 unit/day\nA's efficiency = 2 units/day\nTogether = 3 units/day\n\nTotal work = 3 × 10 = 30 units\nB alone = 30/1 = 30 days\n\n5. Pipes and Cisterns:\nFilling and emptying tanks\n\nExample: Pipe A fills tank in 6 hours, pipe B empties in 8 hours. If both open, time to fill?\n\nSolution:\nA's filling rate = 1/6 per hour\nB's emptying rate = -1/8 per hour\nNet rate = 1/6 - 1/8 = 4/24 - 3/24 = 1/24\nTime to fill = 24 hours\n\n6. Man-Days Concept:\nWork = Men × Days\n\nExample: 10 men complete work in 15 days. How many men needed to complete in 10 days?\n\nSolution:\nTotal man-days = 10 × 15 = 150\nMen needed = 150/10 = 15 men\n\n7. Work and Wages:\nPay distribution based on work\n\nExample: A, B, C can do work in 10, 12, 15 days. They get ₹3000. Find A's share.\n\nSolution:\nWork ratio = 1/10 : 1/12 : 1/15\n= 6:5:4 (LCM = 60)\nTotal parts = 15\nA's share = (6/15) × 3000 = ₹1200\n\nKey Formulas:\n\n1. Combined Efficiency:\nIf A does in a days, B in b days:\nTogether = ab/(a+b) days\n\n2. Part of Work:\nWork done = (Efficiency × Time) / Total Work\n\n3. Man-Day Formula:\nM₁D₁ = M₂D₂\n(Men and Days are inversely proportional)\n\n4. Efficiency:\nIf A is x times efficient as B:\nA's time = B's time / x\n\nTricks:\n\n1. LCM Method:\nFind LCM of days as total work\nCalculate efficiency of each\nEasier for complex problems\n\nExample: A in 6 days, B in 8 days\nLCM = 24 (total work)\nA's efficiency = 4/day\nB's efficiency = 3/day\nTogether = 7/day\nTime = 24/7 days\n\n2. Negative Work:\nFor emptying/destroying:\nUse negative sign in efficiency\n\n3. Work Remaining:\nAlways express as fraction:\nIf 2/5 done, remaining = 3/5"

      "content": "Speed, distance, and time problems test understanding of motion and relative speed concepts.\n\nBasic Formula:\nDistance = Speed × Time\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nTypes of Problems:\n\n1. Basic Motion:\nSimple distance-speed-time\n\nExample: A car travels at 60 km/hr for 3 hours. What distance?\n\nSolution:\nDistance = 60 × 3 = 180 km\n\n2. Relative Speed:\nSame direction and opposite direction\n\nSame direction: Relative speed = S₁ - S₂\nOpposite direction: Relative speed = S₁ + S₂\n\nExample: Two trains 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr moving in same direction. Relative speed?\nSolution: 60 - 40 = 20 km/hr\n\n3. Meeting Point:\nWhen two objects moving towards each other meet\n\nExample: A and B are 100 km apart, moving towards each other at 30 km/hr and 20 km/hr. When do they meet?\n\nSolution:\nRelative speed = 30 + 20 = 50 km/hr\nTime = 100/50 = 2 hours\n\n4. Catching Up:\nOne following another\n\nExample: A starts from point P at 20 km/hr. After 2 hours, B starts from P at 30 km/hr. When does B catch A?\n\nSolution:\nIn 2 hours, A covers = 20 × 2 = 40 km\nRelative speed = 30 - 20 = 10 km/hr\nTime for B to cover 40 km gap = 40/10 = 4 hours\nB catches A after 4 hours from B's start\n\n5. Average Speed:\nFor journey with different speeds\n\nFormula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nExample: Goes 60 km at 30 km/hr, returns at 20 km/hr. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nTime for first = 60/30 = 2 hours\nTime for return = 60/20 = 3 hours\nTotal distance = 120 km\nTotal time = 5 hours\nAverage speed = 120/5 = 24 km/hr\n\nNOTE: Average speed ≠ Average of speeds\n\n6. Boats and Streams:\nSpeed in still water vs in current\n\nDownstream speed = Speed in still water + Stream speed\nUpstream speed = Speed in still water - Stream speed\n\nExample: Boat speed 20 km/hr in still water. Stream 5 km/hr. Find downstream speed.\n\nSolution:\nDownstream = 20 + 5 = 25 km/hr\n\n7. Trains:\nLength of train matters\n\nTime to cross = (Length of train + Length of object) / Speed\n\nExample: 200m train crosses 300m bridge at 36 km/hr. Time taken?\n\nSolution:\nTotal distance = 200 + 300 = 500 m\nSpeed = 36 km/hr = 10 m/s\nTime = 500/10 = 50 seconds\n\n8. Unit Conversion:\nkm/hr to m/s and vice versa\n\nkm/hr to m/s: Multiply by 5/18\nm/s to km/hr: Multiply by 18/5\n\nExample: 72 km/hr = ? m/s\nSolution: 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s\n\nKey Formulas:\n\n1. Average speed for equal distances:\nIf d km at s₁ km/hr and d km at s₂ km/hr:\nAverage speed = 2s₁s₂/(s₁+s₂)\n\n2. Boat problems:\nSpeed in still water = (Downstream + Upstream)/2\nStream speed = (Downstream - Upstream)/2\n\n3. Two trains crossing:\nTime = (L₁ + L₂)/(S₁ + S₂) [opposite direction]\nTime = (L₁ + L₂)/(S₁ - S₂) [same direction]\n\n4. Distance covered when speeds are in ratio:\nIf speeds are in ratio a:b\nDistances covered in same time are also a:b\n\nSpecial Cases:\n\n1. Circular Track:\nTo meet again:\nTime = Length of track / Relative speed\n\n2. Objects at different times:\nInitial gap + distance to cover\n\n3. Races:\nIf A beats B by x meters:\nWhen A finishes, B is x meters behind\n\nTricks:\n\n1. For equal distance journeys:\nAverage speed = Harmonic mean of speeds\n\n2. Quick conversion:\n18 km/hr = 5 m/s\n36 km/hr = 10 m/s\n72 km/hr = 20 m/s\n\n3. Time saved:\nTime saved = Distance × (1/S₁ - 1/S₂)"
