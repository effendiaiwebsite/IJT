      "content": "Number Series questions test your ability to identify patterns in sequences of numbers and find missing or wrong terms.\n\nWhat is a Number Series?\nA number series is a sequence of numbers arranged according to a specific rule or pattern. You need to identify the pattern and find the missing number or the wrong number in the series.\n\nWhy Number Series is Important:\n- Tests pattern recognition skills\n- Evaluates logical thinking\n- Commonly asked in SSC GD (3-4 questions)\n- Builds analytical ability\n- Essential for mathematical reasoning\n\nTypes of Number Series Questions:\n1. Missing Number - Find the next number in sequence\n2. Wrong Number - Identify which number doesn't fit\n3. Missing Term - Find number at specific position\n4. Complete the Series - Multiple missing numbers\n\nCommon Series Patterns:\n1. Arithmetic Progression (AP) - Constant difference\n2. Geometric Progression (GP) - Constant ratio\n3. Square/Cube Series - Powers of numbers\n4. Prime Number Series - Prime sequence\n5. Fibonacci Type - Sum of previous terms\n6. Mixed Operations - Combination of operations\n7. Two-Tier Series - Alternating patterns\n\nKey Skills Required:\n- Number sense\n- Pattern recognition\n- Quick calculation\n- Logical reasoning\n- Knowledge of number properties\n\nBasic Approach:\n1. Write down the series\n2. Find differences between consecutive terms\n3. Check for patterns (addition, multiplication, squares)\n4. Identify the rule\n5. Apply rule to find answer\n6. Verify your answer"

(Simple AP)\n- Are differences increasing/decreasing? (Complex AP)\n- Is there a pattern in differences?\n\nStep 3: Find Next Difference\nBased on the pattern identified\n\nStep 4: Calculate Answer\nAdd/subtract next difference to last term\n\nExample Problem:\nSeries: 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, ?\n\nStep 1: Differences\n8-3=5, 15-8=7, 24-15=9, 35-24=11\nDifferences: +5, +7, +9, +11\n\nStep 2: Pattern\nDifferences increasing by 2 each time\n\nStep 3: Next Difference\n11 + 2 = 13\n\nStep 4: Answer\n35 + 13 = 48\n\nCommon AP Patterns:\n- Consecutive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n- Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\n- Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50\n\nTips:\n- Write down differences clearly\n- Look for second-level differences if first level varies\n- Common differences: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10\n- Pattern often continues logically"
