      "title": "Mathematical Problems - Number-Based Questions",
      "content": "Mathematical problems involve calculations and require both reasoning and mathematical skills.\n\nCommon Mathematical Problem Types:\n\n1. Age Problems:\nBasic concept: Past age, present age, future age\n\nExample: Ram is 5 years older than Shyam. After 10 years, Ram will be twice as old as Shyam was 5 years ago. Find their present ages.\n\nSolution approach:\n- Let Shyam's present age = x\n- Ram's present age = x + 5\n- After 10 years: Ram = x + 15, Shyam = x + 10\n- 5 years ago: Shyam = x - 5\n- According to question: x + 15 = 2(x - 5)\n- x + 15 = 2x - 10\n- x = 25 (Shyam), Ram = 30\n\n2. Number Problems:\nFinding unknown numbers based on given conditions\n\nExample: The sum of two numbers is 50 and their difference is 10. Find the numbers.\nSolution:\n- Let numbers be x and y\n- x + y = 50\n- x - y = 10\n- Adding: 2x = 60, so x = 30\n- Therefore: y = 20\n- Numbers are 30 and 20\n\n3. Average Problems:\nExample: Average of 5 numbers is 20. If one number is 30, what is the average of remaining 4?\nSolution:\n- Sum of 5 numbers = 5 × 20 = 100\n- Sum of 4 numbers = 100 - 30 = 70\n- Average of 4 numbers = 70 ÷ 4 = 17.5\n\n4. Percentage Problems:\nExample: A number increased by 20% becomes 60. Find the original number.\nSolution:\n- Let original number = x\n- x + 20% of x = 60\n- x + 0.2x = 60\n- 1.2x = 60\n- x = 50\n\nKey Formulas:\n- Position from opposite end = Total - Position from one end + 1\n- Present age problems: Set variables for present ages\n- Sum and difference: Add equations to eliminate variables\n- Average = Sum of values ÷ Number of values"

      "title": "Time and Work Problems",
      "content": "Time and work problems involve finding how long it takes to complete a task or how much work is done in given time.\n\nBasic Concepts:\n\n1. Work Done = Time × Efficiency\n2. If A can do work in 'n' days, work done in 1 day = 1/n\n3. If A and B work together, combined work in 1 day = 1/a + 1/b\n\nCommon Problem Types:\n\n1. Individual Work:\nExample: A can complete a work in 10 days. In how many days will he complete half the work?\nSolution:\n- Work done in 1 day = 1/10\n- For half work = (1/2) ÷ (1/10) = 5 days\n\n2. Combined Work:\nExample: A can do work in 12 days, B can do it in 15 days. If they work together, in how many days will they complete it?\nSolution:\n- A's 1 day work = 1/12\n- B's 1 day work = 1/15\n- Together in 1 day = 1/12 + 1/15 = 5/60 + 4/60 = 9/60 = 3/20\n- Time taken = 20/3 = 6⅔ days\n\n3. Pipes and Cisterns:\nExample: Pipe A fills a tank in 6 hours, Pipe B empties it in 8 hours. If both are open, in how many hours will the tank be filled?\nSolution:\n- A's work (filling) = 1/6 per hour\n- B's work (emptying) = -1/8 per hour\n- Net work = 1/6 - 1/8 = 4/24 - 3/24 = 1/24\n- Time to fill = 24 hours\n\n4. Work and Wages:\nExample: A and B can do work in 10 and 15 days respectively. They work together for 5 days, then A leaves. In how many more days will B finish?\nSolution:\n- Work done in 5 days = 5(1/10 + 1/15) = 5(1/6) = 5/6\n- Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6\n- Time for B to finish = (1/6) ÷ (1/15) = 15/6 = 2.5 days\n\nKey Points:\n- Always find work done in 1 day first\n- For combined work, add individual work rates\n- For emptying/filling, subtract the rates\n- Total work is considered as 1 unit"

      "content": "Problems involving distance, speed, and time are common in SSC GD exam and require understanding of basic motion concepts.\n\nBasic Formula:\nDistance = Speed × Time\nSpeed = Distance ÷ Time\nTime = Distance ÷ Speed\n\nCommon Problem Types:\n\n1. Basic Distance Problems:\nExample: A car travels at 60 km/hr for 3 hours. What distance does it cover?\nSolution: Distance = 60 × 3 = 180 km\n\n2. Finding Speed:\nExample: A person covers 100 km in 2 hours. Find his speed.\nSolution: Speed = 100 ÷ 2 = 50 km/hr\n\n3. Finding Time:\nExample: A train travels 240 km at 80 km/hr. How long does it take?\nSolution: Time = 240 ÷ 80 = 3 hours\n\n4. Relative Speed:\nSame direction: Relative speed = Speed₁ - Speed₂\nOpposite direction: Relative speed = Speed₁ + Speed₂\n\nExample: Two trains 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr are moving in same direction. What is relative speed?\nSolution: 60 - 40 = 20 km/hr\n\n5. Meeting Point Problems:\nExample: Two persons A and B are 100 km apart. A travels at 30 km/hr towards B, and B travels at 20 km/hr towards A. When will they meet?\nSolution:\n- Relative speed = 30 + 20 = 50 km/hr (opposite direction)\n- Time to meet = 100 ÷ 50 = 2 hours\n\n6. Average Speed:\nAverage Speed = Total Distance ÷ Total Time\n\nExample: A person travels 60 km at 30 km/hr and returns at 20 km/hr. Find average speed.\nSolution:\n- Time for first journey = 60 ÷ 30 = 2 hours\n- Time for return = 60 ÷ 20 = 3 hours\n- Total distance = 60 + 60 = 120 km\n- Total time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours\n- Average speed = 120 ÷ 5 = 24 km/hr\n\nImportant Points:\n- Speed can be in km/hr, m/s, etc. - convert if needed\n- For m/s to km/hr: multiply by 18/5\n- For km/hr to m/s: multiply by 5/18\n- Draw diagrams for complex problems\n- Check units in the question and answer"

      "content": "Ratio and proportion problems test your ability to understand relationships between quantities.\n\nBasic Concepts:\n\n1. Ratio:\n- Comparison of two quantities\n- Written as a:b or a/b\n- Example: If boys:girls = 3:2, for every 3 boys there are 2 girls\n\n2. Proportion:\n- Equality of two ratios\n- a:b = c:d means a/b = c/d\n- Product of extremes = Product of means: a×d = b×c\n\nCommon Problem Types:\n\n1. Basic Ratio Problems:\nExample: Divide 100 in ratio 2:3.\nSolution:\n- Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5\n- First part = (2/5) × 100 = 40\n- Second part = (3/5) × 100 = 60\n\n2. Finding Unknown in Ratio:\nExample: Two numbers are in ratio 3:4 and their sum is 84. Find the numbers.\nSolution:\n- Let numbers be 3x and 4x\n- 3x + 4x = 84\n- 7x = 84\n- x = 12\n- Numbers are 36 and 48\n\n3. Ratio of Ages:\nExample: Present ages of A and B are in ratio 3:5. After 4 years, ratio will be 2:3. Find present ages.\nSolution:\n- Present ages: 3x and 5x\n- After 4 years: (3x+4) and (5x+4)\n- (3x+4)/(5x+4) = 2/3\n- 3(3x+4) = 2(5x+4)\n- 9x + 12 = 10x + 8\n- x = 4\n- Present ages: 12 and 20\n\n4. Partnership Problems:\nExample: A and B invest in ratio 4:5. If total profit is 18000, find A's share.\nSolution:\n- Total parts = 4 + 5 = 9\n- A's share = (4/9) × 18000 = 8000\n\n5. Mixture Problems:\nExample: Milk and water are mixed in ratio 4:1. If mixture is 50 liters, find quantity of milk.\nSolution:\n- Total parts = 4 + 1 = 5\n- Milk = (4/5) × 50 = 40 liters\n\n6. Compound Ratio:\nExample: If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:B:C.\nSolution:\n- Make B common: A:B = 8:12 and B:C = 12:15\n- Therefore: A:B:C = 8:12:15\n\nKey Formulas:\n- If a:b and sum is S, then a = (a/(a+b)) × S\n- In proportion a:b = c:d, we get a×d = b×c\n- Total parts = sum of all ratio parts"

      "content": "Complex problems require combining multiple concepts and solving step by step.\n\nApproach to Complex Problems:\n\n1. Break Down the Problem:\n- Read carefully and identify all given information\n- List what is asked\n- Identify which concepts are involved\n- Break into smaller sub-problems\n\n2. Multi-Concept Problems:\nExample: A and B start from same point. A travels North at 5 km/hr, B travels East at 12 km/hr. After 2 hours, how far apart are they?\n\nSolution:\n- After 2 hours:\n  A covers: 5 × 2 = 10 km North\n  B covers: 12 × 2 = 24 km East\n- They form a right triangle\n- Distance = √(10² + 24²) = √(100 + 576) = √676 = 26 km\n\n3. Problems with Multiple Conditions:\nExample: In a class, boys and girls are in ratio 3:2. If 5 boys leave and 5 girls join, ratio becomes 4:5. Find total students initially.\n\nSolution:\n- Let boys = 3x, girls = 2x\n- After change: boys = 3x-5, girls = 2x+5\n- (3x-5)/(2x+5) = 4/5\n- 5(3x-5) = 4(2x+5)\n- 15x - 25 = 8x + 20\n- 7x = 45\n- x = 45/7 (not integer, check problem)\n\n4. Work-Time-Wage Combined:\nExample: A can do work in 10 days, B in 15 days. They work for 3 days together, then A leaves. B completes remaining work. If total payment is 3000, how much should B get?\n\nSolution:\n- Work in 3 days = 3(1/10 + 1/15) = 3(1/6) = 1/2\n- Remaining = 1/2\n- Time for B = (1/2)/(1/15) = 7.5 days\n- Total: A worked 3 days, B worked 10.5 days\n- Payment ratio = 3:10.5 = 2:7\n- B's share = (7/9) × 3000 = 2333.33\n\n5. Percentage-Ratio Combined:\nExample: Price increased by 25%. By what percentage should consumption be reduced to keep expenditure same?\n\nSolution:\n- Let original price = 100, new price = 125\n- For same expenditure, if consumption was x, now should be y\n- 100x = 125y\n- y = 100x/125 = 0.8x\n- Reduction = 0.2x = 20%\n\nProblem Solving Tips:\n- Draw diagrams where possible\n- Use variables systematically\n- Check if answer is logical\n- Verify with given conditions\n- Practice diverse problem types"
