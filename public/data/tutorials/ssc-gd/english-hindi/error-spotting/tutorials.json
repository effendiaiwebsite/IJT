      "title": "Introduction to Error Spotting",
      "content": "Error Spotting, also known as Error Detection, is an important topic in English language exams like SSC GD. In this type of question, you are given a sentence divided into parts (usually 4-5 parts), and you need to identify which part contains a grammatical error. If there is no error, you select 'No Error'.\n\nError Spotting tests your understanding of:\n- Grammar rules\n- Sentence structure\n- Subject-Verb agreement\n- Tense usage\n- Articles and prepositions\n- Commonly confused words\n- Idioms and phrases\n\nThis chapter will help you identify common errors and improve your grammar accuracy. The key to mastering error spotting is regular practice and understanding of grammar fundamentals."
