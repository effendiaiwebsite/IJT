      "content": "The number system is the foundation of mathematics, consisting of different types of numbers and operations.\n\nWhat is a Number System?\nA number system is a way of representing numbers using digits or symbols. It helps us count, measure, calculate, and solve problems.\n\nWhy Number System is Important:\n- Foundation for all mathematics\n- Essential for daily calculations\n- Frequently tested in SSC GD (4-5 questions)\n- Builds problem-solving skills\n- Practical applications in real life\n\nTypes of Numbers:\n\n1. Natural Numbers (N):\n- Counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n- Start from 1 and go to infinity\n- Used for counting objects\n- Denoted by N = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}\n\n2. Whole Numbers (W):\n- Natural numbers + zero\n- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n- Start from 0\n- Denoted by W = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}\n\n3. Integers (Z):\n- Whole numbers + negative numbers\n- ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n- Include positive, negative, and zero\n- Denoted by Z = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}\n\n4. Rational Numbers (Q):\n- Numbers that can be expressed as p/q where q ≠ 0\n- Examples: 1/2, 3/4, -2/5, 5 (can be written as 5/1)\n- Includes integers, fractions, terminating decimals\n- Can be positive or negative\n\n5. Irrational Numbers:\n- Numbers that cannot be expressed as p/q\n- Non-terminating, non-repeating decimals\n- Examples: √2, √3, π, e\n- Cannot be written as simple fractions\n\n6. Real Numbers (R):\n- All rational and irrational numbers\n- Includes all numbers on number line\n- Everything we commonly use\n\nNumber Line:\n<----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---->\n    -3   -2   -1    0    1    2    3    4\n\nClassification:\nReal Numbers\n├── Rational Numbers\n│   ├── Integers\n│   │   ├── Whole Numbers\n│   │   │   └── Natural Numbers\n│   │   └── Negative Integers\n│   └── Fractions/Decimals\n└── Irrational Numbers\n\nSpecial Numbers:\n\n1. Even Numbers:\n- Divisible by 2\n- Examples: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...\n- Form: 2n where n is any integer\n\n2. Odd Numbers:\n- Not divisible by 2\n- Examples: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...\n- Form: 2n + 1 or 2n - 1\n\n3. Prime Numbers:\n- Numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves\n- Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...\n- 2 is the only even prime number\n- 1 is NOT a prime number\n\n4. Composite Numbers:\n- Numbers with more than two factors\n- Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...\n- Can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself\n\n5. Co-prime Numbers:\n- Two numbers with HCF = 1\n- Examples: (3, 5), (7, 11), (8, 15)\n- No common factor except 1\n\nBasic Properties:\n\n1. Closure Property:\n- Sum/product of two numbers of same type belongs to same type\n- Example: 3 + 5 = 8 (all natural numbers)\n\n2. Commutative Property:\n- a + b = b + a\n- a × b = b × a\n- Order doesn't matter for addition/multiplication\n\n3. Associative Property:\n- (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\n- (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)\n- Grouping doesn't matter\n\n4. Distributive Property:\n- a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c\n- Multiplication distributes over addition\n\nImportant Concepts:\n- Every natural number is a whole number\n- Every whole number is an integer\n- Every integer is a rational number\n- Every rational number is a real number\n- Irrational numbers are also real numbers\n\nApplications in SSC GD:\n- Number properties\n- Divisibility tests\n- HCF and LCM problems\n- Prime factorization\n- Number sequences\n- Word problems"

For powers of 2:\nHCF(16, 32) = 16 (smaller divides larger)\n\n2. For consecutive numbers:\nHCF = 1 (always co-prime)\n\n3. For numbers with obvious common factor:\n12, 18 → both divisible by 6\nCheck: HCF = 6 ✓\n\n4. For multiples:\nIf a = kb, then HCF(a,b) = b\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n\n1. Taking highest power instead of lowest\nWrong: 2³ for HCF of 2² and 2³\nCorrect: 2² (lowest power)\n\n2. Missing common factors in division method\n\n3. Confusing HCF with LCM\nHCF: Highest common (smaller result)\nLCM: Lowest common multiple (larger result)\n\nExam Strategy:\n- Prime factorization for small numbers\n- Division method for larger numbers\n- Check if one divides another\n- Verify HCF ≤ smallest number"

When will they meet at starting point again?\n\nSolution:\nLCM(6, 8) = 24 minutes\n\nComparison: HCF vs LCM\n\nHCF:\n- Highest Common Factor\n- Smaller value\n- Division concept\n- \"Largest that divides all\"\n- Keywords: divide, measure, groups\n\nLCM:\n- Lowest Common Multiple\n- Larger value\n- Multiplication concept\n- \"Smallest divisible by all\"\n- Keywords: together, common, meet\n\nQuick Calculation Tips:\n\n1. For powers of same number:\nLCM = highest power\nLCM(4, 16) = 16\n\n2. For co-primes:\nLCM = product\nLCM(7, 11) = 77\n\n3. For three numbers where two are co-prime:\nLCM(6, 7, 8) = LCM(LCM(6,8), 7)\n\n4. Check divisibility:\nIf 36 is divisible by both 12 and 18\nLCM could be 36\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n\n1. Taking lowest power for LCM\nWrong: 2¹ for LCM of 2² and 2³\nCorrect: 2³ (highest power)\n\n2. Multiplying all numbers directly\nWrong: LCM(4, 6) = 24\nCorrect: LCM(4, 6) = 12\n\n3. Confusing LCM with HCF\n\n4. Forgetting to bring down undivided numbers in division method\n\nExam Strategy:\n- Use (a×b)/HCF formula for two numbers\n- Division method for three or more\n- Check if one is multiple of others\n- Verify LCM is divisible by all numbers"
