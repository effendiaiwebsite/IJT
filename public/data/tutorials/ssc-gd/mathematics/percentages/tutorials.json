      "title": "Introduction to Percentages",
      "content": "Percentage means 'per hundred' or 'out of 100'. It's a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100.\n\nWhat is Percentage?\nPercentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. The symbol % represents 'percent'.\n\nExample: 50% means 50 out of 100, or 50/100, or 1/2.\n\nWhy Percentages are Important:\n- Used in daily life (discounts, taxes, interest)\n- Frequently tested in SSC GD (3-4 questions)\n- Easy scoring topic\n- Practical applications everywhere\n- Base for profit/loss, discount, interest\n\nBasic Concept:\nPercent = (Part / Whole) × 100\n\nExample: If you scored 45 marks out of 50:\nPercentage = (45/50) × 100 = 90%\n\nConversions:\n\n1. Fraction to Percentage:\nMultiply by 100 and add % sign\n\nExamples:\n- 1/4 = (1/4) × 100 = 25%\n- 3/5 = (3/5) × 100 = 60%\n- 7/10 = (7/10) × 100 = 70%\n\n2. Percentage to Fraction:\nDivide by 100 and simplify\n\nExamples:\n- 25% = 25/100 = 1/4\n- 60% = 60/100 = 3/5\n- 75% = 75/100 = 3/4\n\n3. Decimal to Percentage:\nMultiply by 100 and add % sign\n\nExamples:\n- 0.25 = 0.25 × 100 = 25%\n- 0.5 = 0.5 × 100 = 50%\n- 0.75 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%\n\n4. Percentage to Decimal:\nDivide by 100\n\nExamples:\n- 25% = 25/100 = 0.25\n- 50% = 50/100 = 0.5\n- 75% = 75/100 = 0.75\n\nCommon Percentage-Fraction Equivalents (Must Memorize):\n\n10% = 1/10\n12.5% = 1/8\n16.67% = 1/6\n20% = 1/5\n25% = 1/4\n33.33% = 1/3\n40% = 2/5\n50% = 1/2\n60% = 3/5\n66.67% = 2/3\n75% = 3/4\n80% = 4/5\n100% = 1 (whole)\n\nBasic Formulas:\n\n1. Finding x% of a number:\n   x% of N = (x/100) × N\n\n   Example: 20% of 500\n   = (20/100) × 500\n   = 0.2 × 500\n   = 100\n\n2. Finding what % A is of B:\n   Percentage = (A/B) × 100\n\n   Example: What % is 30 of 120?\n   = (30/120) × 100\n   = (1/4) × 100\n   = 25%\n\n3. Finding the whole when part and % are given:\n   Whole = (Part × 100) / Percentage\n\n   Example: 40% of what number is 80?\n   Whole = (80 × 100) / 40\n   = 8000 / 40\n   = 200\n\nQuick Mental Calculations:\n\n10% of N = N/10\n20% of N = N/5\n25% of N = N/4\n50% of N = N/2\n75% of N = 3N/4\n\nExample: 25% of 80\n= 80/4 = 20\n\nPercentage Greater than 100:\nPossible when part is greater than whole\n\nExample: 150 is what % of 100?\n= (150/100) × 100 = 150%\n\nKey Properties:\n\n1. 100% of any number = the number itself\n   100% of 50 = 50\n\n2. Any number is 100% of itself\n   50 = 100% of 50\n\n3. More than 100% means more than the whole\n   120% of 50 = 60 (which is more than 50)\n\n4. 0% of any number = 0\n   0% of 1000 = 0\n\nApplications:\n- Calculating discounts\n- Finding profit/loss percentages\n- Computing interest rates\n- Analyzing data and statistics\n- Comparing quantities\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n- Forgetting to divide by 100\n- Confusing percentage with actual number\n- Wrong formula application\n- Calculation errors"

After Percentage Increase:\nNew Value = Original × (1 + Increase%/100)\n\nExample: Increase 500 by 20%\nNew Value = 500 × (1 + 20/100)\n          = 500 × 1.2\n          = 600\n\nQuick Method:\n500 + 20% of 500 = 500 + 100 = 600\n\n2. After Percentage Decrease:\nNew Value = Original × (1 - Decrease%/100)\n\nExample: Decrease 800 by 25%\nNew Value = 800 × (1 - 25/100)\n          = 800 × 0.75\n          = 600\n\nQuick Method:\n800 - 25% of 800 = 800 - 200 = 600\n\nFinding Original Value:\n\n1. When Increased Value is Given:\nOriginal = New Value / (1 + Increase%/100)\n\nExample: A number increased by 25% becomes 500. Find original.\nOriginal = 500 / (1 + 25/100)\n         = 500 / 1.25\n         = 400\n\nVerification: 400 + 25% of 400 = 400 + 100 = 500 ✓\n\n2. When Decreased Value is Given:\nOriginal = New Value / (1 - Decrease%/100)\n\nExample: A number decreased by 20% becomes 400. Find original.\nOriginal = 400 / (1 - 20/100)\n         = 400 / 0.8\n         = 500\n\nVerification: 500 - 20% of 500 = 500 - 100 = 400 ✓\n\nSuccessive Percentage Changes:\n\nWhen two percentage changes occur one after another:\n\nFormula:\nNet Change = a + b + (ab/100)\n\nwhere a and b are the two percentage changes\n(use negative sign for decrease)\n\nExample 1: Increase by 10% then increase by 20%\na = 10, b = 20\nNet = 10 + 20 + (10 × 20)/100\n    = 10 + 20 + 2\n    = 32%\n\nExample 2: Increase by 20% then decrease by 10%\na = 20, b = -10\nNet = 20 + (-10) + (20 × -10)/100\n    = 20 - 10 - 2\n    = 8%\n\nExample 3: Decrease by 10% then decrease by 20%\na = -10, b = -20\nNet = -10 + (-20) + (-10 × -20)/100\n    = -10 - 20 + 2\n    = -28%\n\nStep-by-Step Method:\n\nExample: Price increases by 20% and then by 10%. Net increase?\n\nStep 1: After first increase (20%)\nIf original = 100\nNew = 100 + 20 = 120\n\nStep 2: After second increase (10% of 120)\n10% of 120 = 12\nFinal = 120 + 12 = 132\n\nNet increase = 132 - 100 = 32%\n\nImportant Cases:\n\n1. Equal Increase and Decrease:\nIf a number increases by x% and then decreases by x%, there is a net decrease.\n\nExample: Increase by 10%, then decrease by 10%\nNet = 10 + (-10) + (10 × -10)/100\n    = 0 - 1 = -1%\n\nAlways results in: x²/100 % decrease\nFor 10%: 10²/100 = 100/100 = 1% decrease\nFor 20%: 20²/100 = 400/100 = 4% decrease\n\n2. To Nullify an Increase:\nIf something increases by x%, to bring it back:\nRequired decrease = [x/(100+x)] × 100\n\nExample: Increased by 25%. To bring back to original:\nDecrease needed = [25/125] × 100 = 20%\n\nVerification:\n100 → 125 (25% increase)\n125 → 100 (20% decrease) ✓\n\n3. To Nullify a Decrease:\nIf something decreases by x%, to bring it back:\nRequired increase = [x/(100-x)] × 100\n\nExample: Decreased by 20%. To bring back:\nIncrease needed = [20/80] × 100 = 25%\n\nVerification:\n100 → 80 (20% decrease)\n80 → 100 (25% increase) ✓\n\nWord Problems:\n\nQuestion: A shopkeeper increases the price of an item by 25% and then gives a 20% discount. What is the net change?\n\nSolution:\na = 25 (increase)\nb = -20 (decrease/discount)\nNet = 25 + (-20) + (25 × -20)/100\n    = 25 - 20 - 5\n    = 0%\n\nNo net change! (Selling at cost price)\n\nExam Tips:\n- Remember successive change formula\n- Equal increase and decrease always result in loss\n- Practice nullifying percentage problems\n- Be careful with signs (+ for increase, - for decrease)"

If B's salary is ₹25,000, find A's salary.\n\nSolution:\nA's salary = B's salary + 20% of B's salary\n           = 25000 + (20/100) × 25000\n           = 25000 + 5000\n           = ₹30,000\n\nQuestion: A's salary is 20% less than B's. If A's salary is ₹24,000, find B's salary.\n\nSolution:\nLet B's salary = x\nA's salary = 80% of x\n24000 = 0.8x\nx = 24000/0.8 = ₹30,000\n\nCross-Percentage Problems:\n\nQuestion: In a class, 60% are boys. 40% of boys and 50% of girls passed. What % of class passed?\n\nSolution:\nAssume total = 100 students\nBoys = 60, Girls = 40\n\nPassed boys = 40% of 60 = 24\nPassed girls = 50% of 40 = 20\nTotal passed = 24 + 20 = 44\n\nPercentage = 44%\n\nAlternate:\n(60/100 × 40/100) + (40/100 × 50/100)\n= 24/100 + 20/100\n= 44/100 = 44%\n\nMultiple Successive Changes:\n\nQuestion: A price increases by 10%, then by 20%, then decreases by 10%. What is net change?\n\nSolution:\nAssume original = 100\n\nAfter first increase: 100 × 1.1 = 110\nAfter second increase: 110 × 1.2 = 132\nAfter decrease: 132 × 0.9 = 118.8\n\nNet change = 118.8 - 100 = 18.8%\n\nReversing Percentage Changes:\n\nQuestion: A number is increased by 50%. By what percent should the result be decreased to get the original number?\n\nSolution:\nMethod 1:\nLet original = 100\nAfter increase = 150\nTo get back to 100, decrease = 50\nPercentage = (50/150) × 100 = 33.33%\n\nMethod 2: Formula\nRequired decrease = [x/(100+x)] × 100\n                  = [50/150] × 100\n                  = 33.33%\n\nQuestion: A number is decreased by 40%. By what percent should it be increased to get original?\n\nSolution:\nRequired increase = [x/(100-x)] × 100\n                  = [40/60] × 100\n                  = 66.67%\n\nPercentage with Consumption:\n\nQuestion: Price of sugar increases by 25%. By what percent should consumption be reduced so that expenditure remains same?\n\nSolution:\nFormula: Reduction = [Increase/(100 + Increase)] × 100\n\nReduction = [25/125] × 100\n          = 20%\n\nVerification:\nOriginal: Price 100, Consumption 100, Expenditure = 10,000\nNew: Price 125, Consumption 80, Expenditure = 10,000 ✓\n\nQuestion: Price decreases by 20%. By what percent can consumption increase keeping expenditure same?\n\nSolution:\nFormula: Increase = [Decrease/(100 - Decrease)] × 100\n\nIncrease = [20/80] × 100\n         = 25%\n\nPercentage Loss/Gain in Value:\n\nQuestion: If the length of a rectangle is increased by 20% and breadth is decreased by 10%, what is the percentage change in area?\n\nSolution:\nLet original: Length = 100, Breadth = 100\nOriginal area = 10,000\n\nNew: Length = 120, Breadth = 90\nNew area = 10,800\n\nChange = 10,800 - 10,000 = 800\nPercentage = (800/10000) × 100 = 8% increase\n\nAlternate (Formula):\nNet = 20 + (-10) + (20 × -10)/100\n    = 20 - 10 - 2\n    = 8% increase\n\nPopulation Growth Problems:\n\nQuestion: A city's population is 100,000.

Attempt Order:\nEasy → Medium → Hard\n- Direct calculations first\n- Word problems second\n- Complex problems last\n\n2. Time Allocation:\n- 40 sec for direct calculation\n- 60 sec for percentage change\n- 75 sec for word problems\n- Skip if > 90 sec\n\n3. Calculation Tips:\n- Use fraction equivalents\n- Mental math for common %\n- Write key steps only\n- Use shortcuts liberally\n\n4. Verification:\n- Answer reasonable?\n- Sign correct (+/-)\n- Check with options\n- Quick reverse check\n\nCommon Question Types:\n\n1. Find x% of N (25%)\n- Direct formula\n- 40 seconds\n- High accuracy expected\n\n2. Percentage increase/decrease (25%)\n- Change formula\n- 50 seconds\n- Medium difficulty\n\n3. Successive changes (15%)\n- Combination formula\n- 60 seconds\n- Requires care\n\n4. Word problems (20%)\n- Multi-step\n- 60-75 seconds\n- Context understanding\n\n5. Reverse calculation (10%)\n- Division method\n- 50 seconds\n- Common confusion\n\n6. Comparison (5%)\n- Relative percentage\n- 45 seconds\n- Base identification\n\nError Prevention Checklist:\n\n✗ Don't forget to divide by 100\n✗ Don't confuse increase with decrease\n✗ Don't add percentages directly for successive\n✗ Don't use wrong base\n✗ Don't skip verification\n\n✓ Always identify the base\n✓ Convert % to decimal/fraction\n✓ Check sign (+ or -)\n✓ Verify answer makes sense\n✓ Use shortcuts where possible\n\nMental Math Practice:\n\nPractice these until instant:\n- 10% of any number\n- 25% of multiples of 4\n- 50% of any number\n- 20% of multiples of 5\n- 33.33% of multiples of 3\n\nSuccessive Change Quick Calc:\n\nMemorize:\n+10%, -10% = -1%\n+20%, -20% = -4%\n+25%, -20% = 0%\n+20%, +10% = +32%\n+10%, +20% = +32%\n\nLast-Minute Revision:\n\nDay Before:\n- Review all formulas\n- Fraction equivalents\n- Successive change formula\n- Common shortcuts\n- Special cases\n\n1 Hour Before:\n- Quick formula glance\n- Deep breath\n- Confidence building\n- Stay calm\n\nDuring Exam:\n- Read carefully\n- Identify type\n- Choose method\n- Calculate accurately\n- Verify answer\n- Manage time\n- Stay focused\n\nExpected Performance:\n\nWith Practice:\n- Easy: 95%+ accuracy\n- Medium: 85%+ accuracy\n- Hard: 75%+ accuracy\n- Overall: 85-90% achievable\n- Time: Average 50-60 sec/question\n\nScoring Strategy:\n\n1. High-scoring section\n2. Limited concepts\n3. Speed comes with practice\n4. Accuracy is achievable\n5. Shortcuts are key\n6. Systematic approach wins\n\nSuccess Checklist:\n\n✓ Formulas memorized\n✓ Fraction equivalents known\n✓ Shortcuts practiced\n✓ Word problem types clear\n✓ Time management ready\n✓ Mental math sharp\n✓ Verification habit formed\n✓ Confident and prepared\n\nFinal Motivation:\n\n- Percentage is scoring and manageable\n- Formulas are simple and few\n- Practice makes perfect\n- You're well prepared\n- Trust your preparation\n- Stay calm and systematic\n- Think clearly, calculate carefully\n- You've got this! 🎯"
