      "title": "Introduction to Ratio and Proportion",
      "content": "Ratio and proportion are fundamental concepts for comparing quantities and solving problems involving relationships between numbers.\n\nWhat is Ratio?\nA ratio is a comparison between two quantities of the same kind. It shows how many times one quantity is of the other.\n\nNotation: a:b (read as 'a is to b')\nAlso written as: a/b\n\nExample: If there are 3 boys and 2 girls:\nRatio of boys to girls = 3:2\n\nWhy Ratio and Proportion is Important:\n- Frequently tested in SSC GD (3-4 questions)\n- Foundation for many topics\n- Used in profit/loss, mixtures, partnerships\n- Practical applications everywhere\n- Easy scoring if concepts are clear\n\nBasic Terms:\n\n1. Terms of Ratio:\nIn a:b, 'a' is the first term (antecedent)\n'b' is the second term (consequent)\n\nExample: In 5:3\nFirst term = 5, Second term = 3\n\n2. Value of Ratio:\nRatio 5:3 has value = 5/3 = 1.67\n\n3. Equal Ratios:\nRatios that have the same value\nExample: 2:3 = 4:6 = 6:9 = 8:12\n(All equal to 2/3)\n\nSimplifying Ratios:\n\nDivide both terms by their HCF\n\nExample 1: Simplify 12:18\nHCF(12, 18) = 6\n12:18 = (12÷6):(18÷6) = 2:3\n\nExample 2: Simplify 24:36:48\nHCF(24, 36, 48) = 12\n24:36:48 = 2:3:4\n\nTypes of Ratios:\n\n1. Simple Ratio: a:b\nExample: 3:5\n\n2. Compound Ratio: Product of two or more ratios\nIf a:b and c:d, compound ratio = ac:bd\nExample: (2:3) and (4:5)\nCompound = (2×4):(3×5) = 8:15\n\n3. Duplicate Ratio: Ratio of squares\na:b gives a²:b²\nExample: 3:4 gives 9:16\n\n4. Triplicate Ratio: Ratio of cubes\na:b gives a³:b³\nExample: 2:3 gives 8:27\n\n5. Sub-duplicate Ratio: Ratio of square roots\na:b gives √a:√b\nExample: 9:16 gives 3:4\n\n6. Inverse/Reciprocal Ratio:\na:b gives b:a\nExample: 3:4 gives 4:3\n\nProperties of Ratios:\n\n1. Multiplication/Division:\nIf a:b, then ka:kb is equivalent (k ≠ 0)\nExample: 2:3 = 4:6 = 6:9 = 8:12\n\n2. Addition:\nIf a:b = c:d, then (a+c):(b+d) is between them\n\n3. Componendo:\nIf a/b = c/d, then (a+b)/b = (c+d)/d\n\n4. Dividendo:\nIf a/b = c/d, then (a-b)/b = (c-d)/d\n\nWhat is Proportion?\nWhen two ratios are equal, they are in proportion.\n\nNotation: a:b :: c:d (read as 'a is to b as c is to d')\nMeans: a/b = c/d\n\nExample: 2:3 :: 4:6 (both equal to 2/3)\n\nTerms of Proportion:\nIn a:b :: c:d\n- a and d are extremes\n- b and c are means\n\nProperty: Product of extremes = Product of means\na × d = b × c\n\nExample: 2:3 :: 4:6\nExtremes: 2, 6 → Product = 12\nMeans: 3, 4 → Product = 12 ✓\n\nContinued Proportion:\nThree numbers a, b, c are in continued proportion if:\na:b = b:c\nThis means b² = ac\nb is called the mean proportional\n\nExample: 2, 4, 8\nCheck: 2:4 = 4:8?\n2/4 = 1/2 and 4/8 = 1/2 ✓\nAlso: 4² = 16 = 2 × 8 ✓\n\nFinding Missing Terms:\n\nType 1: Find fourth term\nIf a:b = c:x\nThen x = (b × c)/a\n\nExample: 3:5 = 6:x\nx = (5 × 6)/3 = 10\n\nType 2: Find third term\nIf a:b = x:d\nThen x = (a × d)/b\n\nExample: 4:7 = x:14\nx = (4 × 14)/7 = 8\n\nBasic Applications:\n\n1. Dividing in Ratio:\nDivide 100 in ratio 2:3\nParts = 2 + 3 = 5\nFirst share = (2/5) × 100 = 40\nSecond share = (3/5) × 100 = 60\n\n2. Finding Quantities:\nRatio of boys to girls is 3:2. If boys are 30, find girls.\n3:2 = 30:x\nx = (2 × 30)/3 = 20 girls\n\n3. Combining Ratios:\nA:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5\nMake B same: A:B = 8:12 and B:C = 12:15\nTherefore, A:B:C = 8:12:15\n\nKey Formulas:\n- If a:b = c:d, then ad = bc\n- If a:b = c:d = e:f, then each = (a+c+e):(b+d+f)\n- Mean proportional of a and c = √(ac)\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n- Forgetting to simplify\n- Wrong order of terms\n- Calculation errors\n- Not finding common term when combining ratios"

Find ratio.\nA:B = 40:60 = 2:3 (dividing by HCF 20)\n\nExample 2: Three amounts are 120, 180, and 240. Find ratio.\nHCF(120, 180, 240) = 60\nRatio = 120:180:240 = 2:3:4\n\nComparing Ratios:\n\nWhich is greater: 3:4 or 5:7?\n\nMethod 1: Cross Multiplication\n3:4 vs 5:7\n3×7 = 21 and 4×5 = 20\nSince 21 > 20, ratio 3:4 is greater\n\nMethod 2: Decimal Conversion\n3:4 = 0.75\n5:7 ≈ 0.714\nSince 0.75 > 0.714, ratio 3:4 is greater\n\nCompounding Ratios:\n\nWhen ratios are multiplied:\n\nExample: Find compound ratio of 2:3, 4:5, and 6:7\nCompound ratio = (2×4×6):(3×5×7)\n                = 48:105\n                = 16:35 (simplifying)\n\nCombining Ratios with Common Term:\n\nType 1: Two ratios with one common term\n\nExample: A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5\nFind A:B:C\n\nStep 1: Make B equal in both\nA:B = 2:3 = 8:12 (multiply by 4)\nB:C = 4:5 = 12:15 (multiply by 3)\n\nStep 2: Combine\nA:B:C = 8:12:15\n\nExample: P:Q = 3:4 and Q:R = 5:6\nMake Q common:\nP:Q = 3:4 = 15:20 (multiply by 5)\nQ:R = 5:6 = 20:24 (multiply by 4)\nP:Q:R = 15:20:24\n\nType 2: Chain of ratios\n\nExample: A:B = 2:3, B:C = 4:5, C:D = 6:7\nFind A:B:C:D\n\nMake B common in first two:\nA:B = 8:12, B:C = 12:15\nSo A:B:C = 8:12:15\n\nMake C common:\nA:B:C = 16:24:30\nC:D = 30:35\n\nFinal: A:B:C:D = 16:24:30:35\n\nRatio of Ratios:\n\nExample: What is the ratio of 2:3 to 4:5?\n\nSolution:\n(2:3)/(4:5) = (2/3)/(4/5)\n            = (2/3) × (5/4)\n            = 10/12\n            = 5:6\n\nIncreasing/Decreasing in Ratio:\n\nExample: A number is 60.

      "content": "Proportion shows the relationship between quantities - they can be directly or inversely proportional.\n\nDirect Proportion:\n\nDefinition: Two quantities are in direct proportion if an increase in one causes proportional increase in the other.\n\nNotation: x ∝ y (x is proportional to y)\nMeans: x/y = constant\nOr: x₁/y₁ = x₂/y₂\n\nExample 1: Cost and Quantity\nIf 5 pens cost ₹50, what is cost of 8 pens?\n\nSolution:\nPens and cost are directly proportional\n5:8 = 50:x\nx = (8 × 50)/5 = ₹80\n\nExample 2: Time and Distance\nIf a car travels 120 km in 2 hours, how far in 5 hours (at same speed)?\n\nSolution:\nDistance ∝ Time\n2:5 = 120:x\nx = (5 × 120)/2 = 300 km\n\nExample 3: Workers and Work\nIf 6 workers complete work in 10 days, in how many days will 15 workers complete same work?\n\nWait, this is INVERSE proportion (more workers → less time)\n\nDirect Proportion Formula:\n\nIf y₁ corresponds to x₁\nand y₂ corresponds to x₂\nThen: y₁/x₁ = y₂/x₂\n\nOr: y₂ = (y₁ × x₂)/x₁\n\nInverse Proportion:\n\nDefinition: Two quantities are in inverse proportion if an increase in one causes proportional decrease in the other.\n\nNotation: x ∝ 1/y\nMeans: xy = constant\nOr: x₁y₁ = x₂y₂\n\nExample 1: Workers and Time\nIf 6 workers complete work in 10 days, in how many days will 15 workers complete same work?\n\nSolution:\nWorkers and days are inversely proportional\nMore workers → less time\n\nWorkers₁ × Days₁ = Workers₂ × Days₂\n6 × 10 = 15 × x\n60 = 15x\nx = 4 days\n\nExample 2: Speed and Time\nIf speed is 60 km/h, time taken is 4 hours. If speed is 80 km/h, find time.\n\nSolution:\nSpeed and time are inversely proportional (for same distance)\nSpeed₁ × Time₁ = Speed₂ × Time₂\n60 × 4 = 80 × x\n240 = 80x\nx = 3 hours\n\nExample 3: Pipes and Time\nIf 3 pipes fill a tank in 12 hours, how many hours for 4 pipes?\n\nSolution:\nPipes × Hours = constant\n3 × 12 = 4 × x\n36 = 4x\nx = 9 hours\n\nInverse Proportion Formula:\n\nIf y₁ corresponds to x₁\nand y₂ corresponds to x₂\nThen: x₁y₁ = x₂y₂\n\nOr: y₂ = (x₁ × y₁)/x₂\n\nIdentifying the Type:\n\nDirect Proportion:\n- Both increase together\n- Both decrease together\n- Ratio remains constant\n- Examples: Cost-Quantity, Distance-Time (constant speed)\n\nInverse Proportion:\n- One increases, other decreases\n- Product remains constant\n- Examples: Speed-Time (constant distance), Workers-Time (constant work)\n\nMixed Problems:\n\nQuestion: 8 men can complete work in 12 days. How many days will 6 men take?\n\nSolution:\nMen and days are inversely proportional\n8 × 12 = 6 × x\n96 = 6x\nx = 16 days\n\nQuestion: If 5 kg of rice costs ₹200, what is cost of 8 kg?\n\nSolution:\nQuantity and cost are directly proportional\n5:8 = 200:x\nx = (8 × 200)/5 = ₹320\n\nThree Quantities:\n\nSometimes work involves multiple variables.\n\nExample: M₁ men can do W₁ work in D₁ days working H₁ hours/day.\nHow many days for M₂ men to do W₂ work working H₂ hours/day?\n\nFormula:\n(M₁ × D₁ × H₁)/W₁ = (M₂ × D₂ × H₂)/W₂\n\nExample: 10 men can do work in 15 days working 8 hours/day. How many days for 12 men working 10 hours/day?\n\nSolution:\n(10 × 15 × 8)/1 = (12 × D₂ × 10)/1\n1200 = 120 × D₂\nD₂ = 10 days\n\nChain Rule:\n\nFor problems with multiple proportions:\n\nDirect: Multiply by (new/old)\nInverse: Multiply by (old/new)\n\nExample: 4 men working 6 hours/day complete work in 10 days. How many days for 5 men working 8 hours/day?\n\nSolution:\nBase = 10 days\n\nMen: 4 to 5 (inverse) → multiply by 4/5\nHours: 6 to 8 (inverse) → multiply by 6/8\n\nDays = 10 × (4/5) × (6/8)\n     = 10 × 24/40\n     = 6 days\n\nPartnership Problems:\n\nExample: A and B invest ₹3000 and ₹5000.

Profit = ₹2200. Find shares.\n\nSolution:\nRatio = (Investment × Time)\nA = 5000 × 6 = 30,000\nB = 4000 × 8 = 32,000\n\nRatio = 30000:32000 = 15:16\n\nA's share = (15/31) × 2200 = ₹1064.52\nB's share = (16/31) × 2200 = ₹1135.48\n\nExam Tips:\n- Identify direct vs inverse\n- Direct: ratio of values\n- Inverse: product of values\n- For mixed problems, handle each variable separately\n- Use chain rule for multiple variables"

      "title": "Mixture and Alligation",
      "content": "Mixture problems involve combining ingredients in specific ratios. Alligation is a quick method for these problems.\n\nBasic Mixture:\n\nExample: Mix liquids A and B in ratio 3:2. If total mixture is 50 liters, find each quantity.\n\nSolution:\nTotal parts = 3 + 2 = 5\nA = (3/5) × 50 = 30 liters\nB = (2/5) × 50 = 20 liters\n\nReplacement Problems:\n\nExample: A 50-liter mixture has milk and water in ratio 3:2. How much mixture should be replaced with water to make ratio 1:1?\n\nSolution:\nInitial:\nMilk = 30 liters\nWater = 20 liters\n\nLet x liters be replaced\nMilk removed = (3/5) × x\nWater removed = (2/5) × x\nWater added = x\n\nFinal:\nMilk = 30 - (3x/5)\nWater = 20 - (2x/5) + x = 20 + (3x/5)\n\nFor ratio 1:1:\n30 - (3x/5) = 20 + (3x/5)\n30 - 20 = (3x/5) + (3x/5)\n10 = (6x/5)\n50 = 6x\nx = 8.33 liters\n\nAlligation Method:\n\nUsed when mixing two items at different prices/percentages to get a desired average.\n\nRule of Alligation:\nIf two ingredients with values A and B are mixed to get mixture with value M, the ratio is:\n\n(B - M) : (M - A)\n\nDiagram:\n    A              B\n     \\            /\n      \\          /\n       \\        /\n           M\n       /        \\\n      /          \\\n   (B-M)      (M-A)\n\nRatio = (B-M):(M-A)\n\nExample 1: Sugar at ₹30/kg is mixed with sugar at ₹40/kg to get mixture worth ₹35/kg. Find ratio.\n\nSolution:\nA = 30, B = 40, M = 35\n\nBy alligation:\nRatio = (40-35):(35-30) = 5:5 = 1:1\n\nExample 2: How much water (free) should be mixed with milk at ₹50/liter to get mixture worth ₹40/liter?\n\nSolution:\nMilk = 50, Water = 0, Mixture = 40\n\nRatio = (50-40):(40-0) = 10:40 = 1:4\n\nFor every 1 liter milk, add 4 liters water.\n\nExample 3: Two varieties of wheat at ₹25/kg and ₹32/kg are mixed in ratio 3:5. Find price of mixture.\n\nSolution:\nTotal weight (in ratio) = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTotal value = (3 × 25) + (5 × 32)\n            = 75 + 160\n            = 235\n\nPrice per kg = 235/8 = ₹29.375\n\nPercentage Mixture:\n\nExample: Two solutions contain 20% and 50% alcohol. In what ratio should they be mixed to get 30% alcohol?\n\nSolution:\nA = 20%, B = 50%, M = 30%\n\nBy alligation:\nRatio = (50-30):(30-20) = 20:10 = 2:1\n\nMix in ratio 2:1 (20% solution : 50% solution)\n\nThree Component Mixture:\n\nExample: A, B, C are mixed in ratio 2:3:5. If A costs ₹10/kg, B costs ₹15/kg, C costs ₹20/kg, find mixture cost.\n\nSolution:\nTotal weight (ratio) = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\n\nTotal cost = (2×10) + (3×15) + (5×20)\n           = 20 + 45 + 100\n           = 165\n\nCost per kg = 165/10 = ₹16.50\n\nFinding Quantity to Add:\n\nExample: 40 liters of 25% solution. How much pure solution (100%) should be added to make it 40%?\n\nSolution:\nLet x liters of pure solution be added\n\nAlcohol initially = 25% of 40 = 10 liters\nAlcohol added = 100% of x = x liters\n\nFinal mixture = 40 + x liters\nFinal alcohol = 10 + x liters\n\nCondition: (10 + x)/(40 + x) = 40/100\n\n100(10 + x) = 40(40 + x)\n1000 + 100x = 1600 + 40x\n60x = 600\nx = 10 liters\n\nUsing Alligation:\nMix 25% and 100% to get 40%\nRatio = (100-40):(40-25) = 60:15 = 4:1\n\nSo 4 parts of 25% and 1 part of 100%\nIf 4 parts = 40 liters\nThen 1 part = 10 liters\n\nMixture Equation:\n\nGeneral formula:\n(Q₁×P₁) + (Q₂×P₂) = (Q₁+Q₂)×P_mix\n\nWhere:\nQ = Quantity\nP = Price/Percentage\n\nExample: 20 kg at ₹30/kg mixed with 30 kg at ₹40/kg. Find mixture price.\n\nSolution:\n(20×30) + (30×40) = 50×P\n600 + 1200 = 50P\n1800 = 50P\nP = ₹36/kg\n\nRepeated Replacement:\n\nExample: From 50 liters of milk, 5 liters is taken out and replaced with water. This is repeated once more. Find final milk quantity.\n\nSolution:\nAfter 1st replacement:\nMilk left = 50 × (45/50) = 45 liters\n\nAfter 2nd replacement:\nMilk left = 45 × (45/50) = 40.5 liters\n\nGeneral formula:\nFinal quantity = Initial × [(V-R)/V]^n\n\nWhere:\nV = Total volume\nR = Replaced volume\nn = Number of times\n\nFor our example:\n= 50 × [(50-5)/50]²\n= 50 × (0.9)²\n= 50 × 0.81\n= 40.5 liters\n\nExam Tips:\n- Use alligation for quick ratio\n- Remember: (Higher-Mean):(Mean-Lower)\n- For percentage, treat as values\n- Verify by calculating both ways\n- Draw alligation diagram for clarity"
