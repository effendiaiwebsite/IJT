      "title": "Introduction to Discount",
      "content": "Discount is a reduction offered on the marked price (or list price) of a product or service. It is a common practice in retail, sales, and trade to attract customers and increase sales volume. When a shopkeeper offers a discount, the customer pays less than the original marked price.\n\nFor example, if a shirt has a marked price of ₹500 and the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount, the customer will pay less than ₹500. Understanding discount calculations is essential for both consumers (to find good deals) and sellers (to determine pricing strategies). In SSC GD exams, discount problems are frequently asked and test your ability to calculate percentages and apply basic arithmetic.\n\nKey point: Discount is always calculated on the marked price (MP), not on the cost price or any other price."

      "title": "Basic Terminology",
      "content": "Before solving discount problems, you must understand these key terms:\n\n**1. Marked Price (MP) or List Price:** The original price at which an item is marked or labeled. This is the price shown on the price tag before any discount is applied.\n\n**2. Discount:** The reduction in price offered by the seller. It can be expressed as a fixed amount (₹50 off) or as a percentage (20% off).\n\n**3. Selling Price (SP):** The final price at which the item is actually sold to the customer after applying the discount. This is what the customer pays.\n\n**Relationship:** Selling Price = Marked Price - Discount\n\nOR\n\nSP = MP - D\n\nRemember: The discount is subtracted from the marked price to get the selling price."

      "title": "Discount Formula",
      "content": "The basic formulas for discount calculations are:\n\n**1. When Discount is given as a percentage:**\n   Discount = (Discount % × Marked Price) / 100\n   \n   OR\n   \n   D = (d × MP) / 100\n   \n   where d = discount percentage\n\n**2. Selling Price formula:**\n   SP = MP - Discount\n   \n   OR\n   \n   SP = MP - (d × MP) / 100\n   \n   OR\n   \n   SP = MP × (100 - d) / 100\n\n**3. Discount Percentage:**\n   Discount % = (Discount / Marked Price) × 100\n   \n   OR\n   \n   d = (D / MP) × 100\n\nExample: A watch is marked at ₹1000. If a 15% discount is offered, find the selling price.\n\nSolution:\nMP = ₹1000, d = 15%\nSP = MP × (100 - d) / 100\nSP = 1000 × (100 - 15) / 100\nSP = 1000 × 85 / 100 = ₹850\n\nTherefore, the selling price is ₹850."

Find the discount percentage.\n\nSolution:\nGiven: MP = ₹8000, SP = ₹7200\n\nDiscount = MP - SP = 8000 - 7200 = ₹800\n\nDiscount % = (Discount / MP) × 100\nDiscount % = (800 / 8000) × 100\nDiscount % = 0.1 × 100\nDiscount % = 10%\n\nTherefore, the discount percentage is 10%.\n\nQuick tip: When the discount is simple, you can mentally calculate. Here, 800 is 1/10 of 8000, which means 10%."

      "content": "Successive discounts (also called multiple discounts) occur when two or more discounts are applied one after the other on the same item. It's important to note that successive discounts are NOT simply added together.\n\n**Key Concept:** The second discount is applied on the price after the first discount, not on the original marked price.\n\n**Formula for two successive discounts:**\n\nIf two successive discounts of d₁% and d₂% are given, the single equivalent discount is:\n\nSingle Equivalent Discount = [d₁ + d₂ - (d₁ × d₂)/100]%\n\nExample: A shirt marked at ₹1000 is offered successive discounts of 20% and 10%.

The equivalent discount is always less than the sum.\n\n3. **For three successive discounts:** If three discounts d₁%, d₂%, and d₃% are given:\n   - First find equivalent of first two: e₁ = d₁ + d₂ - (d₁ × d₂)/100\n   - Then combine with third: Final = e₁ + d₃ - (e₁ × d₃)/100\n   \n   OR directly:\n   SP = MP × (100-d₁)/100 × (100-d₂)/100 × (100-d₃)/100\n\n4. **Customer benefits:** Successive discounts are always more beneficial than a single combined discount.\n\nExample: Successive discounts of 30% and 20%\nEquivalent = 30 + 20 - (30×20)/100 = 50 - 6 = 44%\n(Not 50%!)"
