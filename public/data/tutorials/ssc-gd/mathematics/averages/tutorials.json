      "title": "Introduction to Averages",
      "content": "Average is one of the most practical and frequently tested topics in SSC GD, appearing in 2-3 questions per exam.\n\nWhat is Average?\nAverage (or Arithmetic Mean) is the central value of a set of numbers. It represents the sum of all values divided by the count of values.\n\nFormula:\nAverage = Sum of all observations / Number of observations\n\nOr: Average = Total / Count\n\nExample 1: Find average of 10, 20, 30\nSum = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60\nCount = 3\nAverage = 60/3 = 20\n\nExample 2: Find average of 5, 8, 12, 15, 20\nSum = 5 + 8 + 12 + 15 + 20 = 60\nCount = 5\nAverage = 60/5 = 12\n\nWhy Averages is Important:\n- Common in daily life (marks, temperature, speed, etc.)\n- 2-3 questions in SSC GD exam\n- Easy scoring topic with formulas\n- Foundation for statistics\n- Practical applications everywhere\n\nKey Points:\n- Average is always between the smallest and largest value\n- If all numbers are same, average equals that number\n- Average can be a decimal/fraction even if all numbers are integers\n\nExample 3: Average of 10, 10, 10\nAverage = (10+10+10)/3 = 30/3 = 10\n(When all equal, average equals that value)\n\nExample 4: Average of 5, 10, 12\nSmallest = 5, Largest = 12\nAverage = (5+10+12)/3 = 27/3 = 9\nNote: 5 < 9 < 12 ✓\n\nBasic Properties:\n\n1. Sum from Average:\nIf average of n numbers is A, then:\nSum = Average × Count = A × n\n\nExample: Average of 5 numbers is 20\nSum = 20 × 5 = 100\n\n2. Finding Missing Number:\nIf average of n numbers is known and (n-1) numbers are given:\nMissing number = (Average × n) - Sum of given numbers\n\nExample: Average of 4 numbers is 25. Three numbers are 20, 22, 28. Find fourth.\nSum of 4 numbers = 25 × 4 = 100\nSum of 3 numbers = 20 + 22 + 28 = 70\nFourth number = 100 - 70 = 30\n\n3. Effect of Adding/Removing:\nWhen a number is added/removed, average changes unless:\n- The added/removed number equals the current average\n\nExample: Average of 5 numbers is 20 (sum = 100)\nIf we add 20: New sum = 120, New count = 6\nNew average = 120/6 = 20 (unchanged)\n\nIf we add 30: New sum = 130, New count = 6\nNew average = 130/6 = 21.67 (increased)\n\nAverage of First n Natural Numbers:\n\nFormula: Average = (n+1)/2\n\nExample: Average of first 10 natural numbers\nNumbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10\nAverage = (10+1)/2 = 11/2 = 5.5\n\nVerification: Sum = 1+2+...+10 = 55\nAverage = 55/10 = 5.5 ✓\n\nAverage of First n Even Numbers:\n\nFormula: Average = n+1\n\nExample: Average of first 5 even numbers\nNumbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\nAverage = 5+1 = 6\n\nVerification: Sum = 30, Count = 5\nAverage = 30/5 = 6 ✓\n\nAverage of First n Odd Numbers:\n\nFormula: Average = n\n\nExample: Average of first 5 odd numbers\nNumbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\nAverage = 5\n\nVerification: Sum = 25, Count = 5\nAverage = 25/5 = 5 ✓\n\nAverage of Consecutive Numbers:\n\nFor any consecutive numbers:\nAverage = (First + Last)/2\n\nExample 1: Average of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nAverage = (5+9)/2 = 14/2 = 7\n\nExample 2: Average of 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\nAverage = (15+20)/2 = 35/2 = 17.5\n\nThis also works for:\n- Consecutive even numbers\n- Consecutive odd numbers\n- Any arithmetic progression\n\nTypes of Problems:\n\n1. Direct Calculation: Find average given numbers\n2. Finding Sum: Given average and count\n3. Finding Count: Given average and sum\n4. Finding Missing: Given average and some numbers\n5. Change in Average: When numbers added/removed\n6. Combined Average: Average of multiple groups\n7. Age Average: Average age problems\n8. Speed Average: Average speed problems\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n- Forgetting to divide by count\n- Adding averages (can't add averages directly)\n- Wrong count of numbers\n- Calculation errors\n\nExam Strategy:\n- Identify problem type quickly\n- Use appropriate formula\n- Calculate systematically\n- Verify answer makes sense\n- Check if answer is in range (min to max)"

      "content": "Understanding the relationship between average, sum, and count is fundamental to solving all average problems.\n\nCore Formula Triangle:\n\n        SUM\n       /   \\\n      /     \\\n  AVERAGE × COUNT\n\nFrom this triangle:\n1. Average = Sum / Count\n2. Sum = Average × Count\n3. Count = Sum / Average\n\nType 1: Direct Average Calculation\n\nGiven: Numbers\nFind: Average\nMethod: Sum all numbers and divide by count\n\nExample 1: Find average of 12, 15, 18, 21, 24\nSum = 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 + 24 = 90\nCount = 5\nAverage = 90/5 = 18\n\nExample 2: Find average of 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\nSum = 7 + 14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 = 147\nCount = 6\nAverage = 147/6 = 24.5\n\nShortcut for Arithmetic Progression:\nIf numbers are in AP (constant difference):\nAverage = (First + Last)/2\n\nFor Example 1: Average = (12+24)/2 = 18 ✓\nFor Example 2: Average = (7+42)/2 = 24.5 ✓\n\nType 2: Finding Sum from Average\n\nGiven: Average and Count\nFind: Sum\nFormula: Sum = Average × Count\n\nExample 1: Average of 8 numbers is 35. Find their sum.\nSum = 35 × 8 = 280\n\nExample 2: Average marks of 40 students is 62. Find total marks.\nTotal = 62 × 40 = 2480\n\nExample 3: Average age of 5 people is 28 years. After 3 years, what will be their total age?\nCurrent total = 28 × 5 = 140 years\nAfter 3 years, each increases by 3 years\nIncrease in total = 3 × 5 = 15 years\nNew total = 140 + 15 = 155 years\n\nAlternatively:\nNew average = 28 + 3 = 31 years\nNew total = 31 × 5 = 155 years ✓\n\nType 3: Finding Count from Average and Sum\n\nGiven: Average and Sum\nFind: Count\nFormula: Count = Sum / Average\n\nExample 1: Sum is 360 and average is 40. How many numbers?\nCount = 360/40 = 9 numbers\n\nExample 2: Total runs scored is 3600 and average is 45. How many innings?\nInnings = 3600/45 = 80\n\nType 4: Finding One Number When Average is Given\n\nExample 1: Average of 5 numbers is 30. Four numbers are 25, 28, 32, 35. Find the fifth.\nTotal sum = 30 × 5 = 150\nSum of 4 numbers = 25 + 28 + 32 + 35 = 120\nFifth number = 150 - 120 = 30\n\nExample 2: Average of 6 numbers is 45. If one number 48 is excluded, what is new average?\nOriginal sum = 45 × 6 = 270\nNew sum = 270 - 48 = 222\nNew count = 5\nNew average = 222/5 = 44.4\n\nExample 3: Average of 7 numbers is 50. If one number is increased by 14, what is new average?\nOriginal sum = 50 × 7 = 350\nNew sum = 350 + 14 = 364\nCount remains = 7\nNew average = 364/7 = 52\n\nAlternatively:\nIncrease per number = 14/7 = 2\nNew average = 50 + 2 = 52 ✓\n\nType 5: Effect of Wrong Entry\n\nExample 1: Average of 10 numbers is 50. One number 40 was wrongly taken as 60. Find correct average.\n\nWrong sum = 50 × 10 = 500\nCorrection needed = 60 - 40 = 20 (excess)\nCorrect sum = 500 - 20 = 480\nCorrect average = 480/10 = 48\n\nExample 2: Average of 20 observations is 35. Later found two observations 42 and 38 were wrongly read as 24 and 35. Find correct average.\n\nWrong sum = 35 × 20 = 700\nFirst correction: 42 - 24 = +18\nSecond correction: 38 - 35 = +3\nTotal correction = +21\nCorrect sum = 700 + 21 = 721\nCorrect average = 721/20 = 36.05\n\nType 6: Balancing Method\n\nUseful when numbers are close to a value.\n\nExample: Find average of 47, 52, 48, 53, 45\n\nChoose reference point: 50\nDeviations: -3, +2, -2, +3, -5\nSum of deviations = -3+2-2+3-5 = -5\nAverage deviation = -5/5 = -1\nActual average = 50 + (-1) = 49\n\nVerification:\nSum = 47+52+48+53+45 = 245\nAverage = 245/5 = 49 ✓\n\nType 7: Weighted Average (Introduction)\n\nWhen different items have different importance/weight:\n\nExample: A student scores 80 in a 3-credit subject and 90 in a 2-credit subject. Find weighted average.\n\nWeighted sum = (80 × 3) + (90 × 2) = 240 + 180 = 420\nTotal credits = 3 + 2 = 5\nWeighted average = 420/5 = 84\n\n(Simple average would be (80+90)/2 = 85, but weighted is 84 because 80 has more weight)\n\nApplications:\n\n1. Academic: Average marks calculation\n2. Sports: Average runs, goals, points\n3. Finance: Average income, expenditure\n4. Age: Average age of family, class\n5. Speed: Average speed of journey\n6. Temperature: Average temperature\n7. Daily life: Average consumption, production\n\nQuick Calculations:\n\n1. If sum is obvious:\nUse sum directly\n\n2. If numbers in AP:\nUse (First + Last)/2\n\n3. If numbers close:\nUse balancing method\n\n4. If specific formulas apply:\nFirst n natural, even, odd numbers\n\nExam Tips:\n- Always write: Average = Sum/Count\n- Calculate sum carefully\n- Verify answer is in range\n- Use shortcuts where applicable\n- Check if answer is reasonable"

      "title": "Combined Average and Groups",
      "content": "Combined average problems involve finding the average of multiple groups combined together.\n\nCombined Average Formula:\n\nWhen two groups are combined:\nCombined Average = (n₁A₁ + n₂A₂)/(n₁ + n₂)\n\nWhere:\nn₁ = count in first group\nA₁ = average of first group\nn₂ = count in second group\nA₂ = average of second group\n\nExample 1: Average age of 20 boys is 12 years and average age of 30 girls is 10 years. Find combined average.\n\nSolution:\nn₁ = 20, A₁ = 12\nn₂ = 30, A₂ = 10\n\nCombined average = (20×12 + 30×10)/(20+30)\n                  = (240 + 300)/50\n                  = 540/50\n                  = 10.8 years\n\nExample 2: Average marks of 25 students in Section A is 60 and of 35 students in Section B is 70. Find average marks of all students.\n\nSolution:\nTotal marks in A = 25 × 60 = 1500\nTotal marks in B = 35 × 70 = 2450\nTotal marks = 1500 + 2450 = 3950\nTotal students = 25 + 35 = 60\nAverage = 3950/60 = 65.83 marks\n\nThree Groups:\n\nCombined Average = (n₁A₁ + n₂A₂ + n₃A₃)/(n₁ + n₂ + n₃)\n\nExample: Average of 10 numbers is 20, of 15 numbers is 25, and of 20 numbers is 30. Find combined average.\n\nSolution:\nSum₁ = 10 × 20 = 200\nSum₂ = 15 × 25 = 375\nSum₃ = 20 × 30 = 600\n\nTotal sum = 200 + 375 + 600 = 1175\nTotal count = 10 + 15 + 20 = 45\n\nCombined average = 1175/45 = 26.11\n\nFinding Group Average:\n\nExample 1: Combined average of 50 students is 40. If average of 30 students is 35, find average of remaining 20.\n\nSolution:\nTotal marks of 50 = 50 × 40 = 2000\nMarks of 30 = 30 × 35 = 1050\nMarks of 20 = 2000 - 1050 = 950\nAverage of 20 = 950/20 = 47.5\n\nExample 2: Average of 40 results is 30. Average of first 10 is 25 and of last 10 is 30. Find average of middle 20.\n\nSolution:\nTotal sum = 40 × 30 = 1200\nSum of first 10 = 10 × 25 = 250\nSum of last 10 = 10 × 30 = 300\nSum of middle 20 = 1200 - 250 - 300 = 650\nAverage of middle 20 = 650/20 = 32.5\n\nReplacement Problems:\n\nExample 1: Average of 10 numbers is 50. If one number 60 is replaced by 80, what is new average?\n\nSolution:\nOriginal sum = 10 × 50 = 500\nChange = 80 - 60 = +20\nNew sum = 500 + 20 = 520\nNew average = 520/10 = 52\n\nAlternatively:\nIncrease per number = 20/10 = 2\nNew average = 50 + 2 = 52\n\nExample 2: Average weight of 20 students is 50 kg. If a student of 45 kg leaves and a new student joins, the average becomes 50.5 kg. Find weight of new student.\n\nSolution:\nOriginal total = 20 × 50 = 1000 kg\nNew total = 20 × 50.5 = 1010 kg\nIncrease = 1010 - 1000 = 10 kg\n\nNew student weight = 45 + 10 = 55 kg\n\nVerification:\n(1000 - 45 + 55)/20 = 1010/20 = 50.5 ✓\n\nJoining and Leaving:\n\nExample 1: Average age of 8 people is 30 years. A person aged 40 leaves and two persons aged 25 and 35 join. Find new average.\n\nSolution:\nOriginal total = 8 × 30 = 240 years\nAfter leaving: 240 - 40 = 200 years (7 people)\nAfter joining: 200 + 25 + 35 = 260 years (9 people)\nNew average = 260/9 = 28.89 years\n\nExample 2: Average of 6 numbers is 35. If 2 numbers with average 40 are removed and 3 numbers with average 30 are added, find new average.\n\nSolution:\nOriginal sum = 6 × 35 = 210\nRemoved sum = 2 × 40 = 80\nAdded sum = 3 × 30 = 90\n\nNew sum = 210 - 80 + 90 = 220\nNew count = 6 - 2 + 3 = 7\nNew average = 220/7 = 31.43\n\nSequential Changes:\n\nExample: Average of 5 numbers is 20. When one number is added, average becomes 22. When another number is added, average becomes 24. Find the two added numbers.\n\nSolution:\nInitial sum = 5 × 20 = 100\n\nAfter first addition:\nNew sum = 6 × 22 = 132\nFirst added number = 132 - 100 = 32\n\nAfter second addition:\nNew sum = 7 × 24 = 168\nSecond added number = 168 - 132 = 36\n\nDistribution with Same Total:\n\nExample: 100 students have average marks 50. They are divided into two groups of 60 and 40. If average of first group is 55, find average of second.\n\nSolution:\nTotal marks = 100 × 50 = 5000\nMarks of first 60 = 60 × 55 = 3300\nMarks of second 40 = 5000 - 3300 = 1700\nAverage of second 40 = 1700/40 = 42.5\n\nEqual Groups:\n\nExample: Average of 60 students is 40. They are divided into 3 equal groups. If first group has average 35 and second has 40, find third group's average.\n\nSolution:\nEach group has 60/3 = 20 students\nTotal = 60 × 40 = 2400\n\nGroup 1 sum = 20 × 35 = 700\nGroup 2 sum = 20 × 40 = 800\nGroup 3 sum = 2400 - 700 - 800 = 900\n\nGroup 3 average = 900/20 = 45\n\nWeighted Average Application:\n\nExample: In a class of 50, boys average 70 and girls average 80. If class average is 72, how many boys and girls?\n\nSolution:\nLet boys = x, then girls = 50-x\n\nTotal marks = (x × 70) + ((50-x) × 80)\n            = 70x + 4000 - 80x\n            = 4000 - 10x\n\nAlso, total marks = 50 × 72 = 3600\n\nTherefore: 4000 - 10x = 3600\n10x = 400\nx = 40\n\nBoys = 40, Girls = 10\n\nExam Tips:\n- For combined groups, find total sum first\n- Track count changes carefully\n- For replacement, find the difference\n- Use algebra for unknown counts\n- Verify final answer makes sense"

      "content": "Average speed problems are special cases where distance and time are involved.\n\nAverage Speed:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nImportant: Average speed ≠ Average of speeds\n\nExample 1: A person travels 100 km in 2 hours and then 150 km in 3 hours. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nTotal distance = 100 + 150 = 250 km\nTotal time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours\nAverage speed = 250/5 = 50 km/h\n\nNote: Average of speeds = (50 + 50)/2 = 50 km/h (coincidentally same)\nBut this is not the correct method!\n\nExample 2: A car travels first half distance at 40 km/h and second half at 60 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nSolution Method 1 (Correct):\nLet total distance = 120 km (LCM of 40 and 60)\nFirst half = 60 km at 40 km/h, time = 60/40 = 1.5 hours\nSecond half = 60 km at 60 km/h, time = 60/60 = 1 hour\n\nTotal distance = 120 km\nTotal time = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 hours\nAverage speed = 120/2.5 = 48 km/h\n\nSolution Method 2 (Formula):\nWhen equal distances covered at speeds v₁ and v₂:\nAverage speed = (2v₁v₂)/(v₁ + v₂)\n\nAverage speed = (2 × 40 × 60)/(40 + 60)\n               = 4800/100\n               = 48 km/h\n\nEqual Distance Formula:\n\nFor two equal distances at speeds v₁ and v₂:\nAverage Speed = (2v₁v₂)/(v₁ + v₂)\n\nThis is the Harmonic Mean of two speeds.\n\nExample 1: A person goes from A to B at 30 km/h and returns at 20 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nAverage speed = (2 × 30 × 20)/(30 + 20)\n               = 1200/50\n               = 24 km/h\n\n(NOT (30+20)/2 = 25 km/h!)\n\nExample 2: Train travels first 100 km at 50 km/h and next 100 km at 60 km/h. Average speed?\n\nSolution:\nAverage = (2 × 50 × 60)/(50 + 60)\n        = 6000/110\n        = 54.55 km/h\n\nThree Equal Parts:\n\nIf three equal distances at speeds v₁, v₂, v₃:\nAverage Speed = (3v₁v₂v₃)/(v₁v₂ + v₂v₃ + v₃v₁)\n\nExample: A travels equal distances at 20, 30, and 60 km/h.

Average speed?\n\nSolution Method 1:\nDistance₁ = 40 × 2 = 80 km\nDistance₂ = 60 × 2 = 120 km\nTotal distance = 200 km\nTotal time = 4 hours\nAverage = 200/4 = 50 km/h\n\nSolution Method 2 (Formula):\nAverage = (40 + 60)/2 = 50 km/h\n\nExample 2: A car travels at 30 km/h, 40 km/h, and 50 km/h for equal durations. Average speed?\n\nSolution:\nAverage = (30 + 40 + 50)/3 = 120/3 = 40 km/h\n\nMixed Problems:\n\nExample 1: A person travels 120 km at 60 km/h and 180 km at 90 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nTime₁ = 120/60 = 2 hours\nTime₂ = 180/90 = 2 hours\nTotal distance = 120 + 180 = 300 km\nTotal time = 2 + 2 = 4 hours\nAverage speed = 300/4 = 75 km/h\n\nExample 2: A train covers first one-third distance at 20 km/h, second one-third at 30 km/h, and last one-third at 60 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nLet total distance = 60 km (LCM)\nEach part = 20 km\n\nTime₁ = 20/20 = 1 hour\nTime₂ = 20/30 = 2/3 hour\nTime₃ = 20/60 = 1/3 hour\n\nTotal time = 1 + 2/3 + 1/3 = 2 hours\nAverage speed = 60/2 = 30 km/h\n\nRest Period Inclusion:\n\nExample: A person walks 40 km at 10 km/h, then rests for 2 hours, then walks another 20 km at 10 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nTime for first 40 km = 40/10 = 4 hours\nRest time = 2 hours\nTime for next 20 km = 20/10 = 2 hours\n\nTotal distance = 40 + 20 = 60 km\nTotal time = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 hours\nAverage speed = 60/8 = 7.5 km/h\n\nNote: Rest time is included in total time!\n\nPartial Journey:\n\nExample: A travels half time at 40 km/h and half time at 60 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nSince equal time:\nAverage = (40 + 60)/2 = 50 km/h\n\nExample: A travels half distance at 30 km/h. If average speed for whole journey is 45 km/h, find speed for second half.\n\nSolution:\nLet second half speed = v\nUsing equal distance formula:\n45 = (2 × 30 × v)/(30 + v)\n45(30 + v) = 60v\n1350 + 45v = 60v\n1350 = 15v\nv = 90 km/h\n\nRound Trip:\n\nExample: A goes from home to office at 30 km/h and returns at 45 km/h. Find average speed for entire journey.\n\nSolution:\nThis is equal distance problem:\nAverage = (2 × 30 × 45)/(30 + 45)\n        = 2700/75\n        = 36 km/h\n\nDifferent Modes:\n\nExample: A person travels 60 km by car at 60 km/h, then 40 km by train at 80 km/h. Find average speed.\n\nSolution:\nTime by car = 60/60 = 1 hour\nTime by train = 40/80 = 0.5 hour\nTotal distance = 100 km\nTotal time = 1.5 hours\nAverage speed = 100/1.5 = 66.67 km/h\n\nKey Formulas Summary:\n\n1. General: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n2. Equal Distance (2 speeds): (2v₁v₂)/(v₁ + v₂)\n3. Equal Time (2 speeds): (v₁ + v₂)/2\n4. Equal Distance (3 speeds): (3v₁v₂v₃)/(v₁v₂ + v₂v₃ + v₃v₁)\n\nCommon Mistakes:\n- Taking average of speeds directly\n- Forgetting rest time\n- Confusing equal distance vs equal time\n- Using wrong formula\n\nExam Tips:\n- Identify: Equal distance or equal time?\n- Use appropriate formula\n- For general case, calculate time first\n- Average speed < Arithmetic mean (for unequal distances)\n- Always use Total Distance / Total Time when in doubt"

      "content": "Age average problems are very common in SSC GD and involve understanding how ages change over time.\n\nKey Principle:\nWhen time passes, everyone's age increases equally.\nIf n people age by t years each:\nTotal age increase = n × t\n\nExample 1: Average age of 5 people is 30 years. After 5 years, what will be average age?\n\nSolution:\nCurrent total age = 5 × 30 = 150 years\nAfter 5 years, each person's age increases by 5\nTotal increase = 5 × 5 = 25 years\nNew total = 150 + 25 = 175 years\nNew average = 175/5 = 35 years\n\nShortcut: New average = 30 + 5 = 35 years\n\nRule: When all members age by t years, average also increases by t years.\n\nExample 2: Average age of 8 members was 28 years. 4 years ago, what was their average age?\n\nSolution:\nCurrent total = 8 × 28 = 224 years\n4 years ago, each was 4 years younger\nTotal decrease = 8 × 4 = 32 years\nPast total = 224 - 32 = 192 years\nPast average = 192/8 = 24 years\n\nShortcut: Past average = 28 - 4 = 24 years\n\nMember Joins:\n\nExample 1: Average age of 6 family members is 25 years. A baby is born. After 2 years, what is average age?\n\nSolution:\nCurrent total = 6 × 25 = 150 years\n\nAfter 2 years:\n- 6 original members each age by 2: 150 + (6×2) = 162 years\n- Baby's age = 2 years\n- Total members = 7\n\nTotal age = 162 + 2 = 164 years\nAverage = 164/7 = 23.43 years\n\nExample 2: Average age of 10 students is 20 years. When a new student joins, average becomes 19.5 years. Find age of new student.\n\nSolution:\nOriginal total = 10 × 20 = 200 years\nNew total = 11 × 19.5 = 214.5 years\nNew student age = 214.5 - 200 = 14.5 years\n\nMember Leaves:\n\nExample: Average age of 9 members is 30 years. When one member aged 45 leaves, what is new average?\n\nSolution:\nOriginal total = 9 × 30 = 270 years\nAfter leaving = 270 - 45 = 225 years\nNew count = 8\nNew average = 225/8 = 28.125 years\n\nReplacement:\n\nExample 1: Average age of 11 players is 28 years. If a player aged 35 is replaced by another, average decreases by 1 year. Find age of new player.\n\nSolution:\nNew average = 28 - 1 = 27 years\nOriginal total = 11 × 28 = 308 years\nNew total = 11 × 27 = 297 years\nDecrease = 308 - 297 = 11 years\n\nSince one player replaced:\nNew player age = 35 - 11 = 24 years\n\nExample 2: Average age of 15 members is 32 years. Two members aged 30 and 35 leave and two new members join. If average increases by 2 years, find total age of new members.\n\nSolution:\nNew average = 32 + 2 = 34 years\nOriginal total = 15 × 32 = 480 years\nNew total = 15 × 34 = 510 years\nIncrease needed = 510 - 480 = 30 years\n\nAge removed = 30 + 35 = 65 years\nAge added = 65 + 30 = 95 years\n\nTotal age of new members = 95 years\n\nTeacher-Student Problems:\n\nExample 1: Average age of 40 students is 15 years. When teacher's age is included, average becomes 16 years. Find teacher's age.\n\nSolution:\nTotal age of students = 40 × 15 = 600 years\nTotal with teacher = 41 × 16 = 656 years\nTeacher's age = 656 - 600 = 56 years\n\nExample 2: Average age of 30 students and their teacher is 16 years. If teacher's age is excluded, average becomes 15 years. Find teacher's age.\n\nSolution:\nTotal with teacher = 31 × 16 = 496 years\nTotal students = 30 × 15 = 450 years\nTeacher's age = 496 - 450 = 46 years\n\nFamily Age Problems:\n\nExample 1: Average age of husband, wife and child is 27 years. Average age of husband and wife is 30 years. Find child's age.\n\nSolution:\nTotal of all three = 3 × 27 = 81 years\nTotal of husband and wife = 2 × 30 = 60 years\nChild's age = 81 - 60 = 21 years\n\nExample 2: Average age of father and son is 30 years. Average age of father, mother and son is 28 years. Find mother's age.\n\nSolution:\nTotal of father and son = 2 × 30 = 60 years\nTotal of all three = 3 × 28 = 84 years\nMother's age = 84 - 60 = 24 years\n\nBirth Impact:\n\nExample: Average age of 4 family members is 25 years. A baby is born and after 5 years, average age of family is 20 years. Find present age of baby.\n\nSolution:\nPresent total of 4 = 4 × 25 = 100 years\nLet baby's present age = x years\n\nAfter 5 years:\nTotal of 4 members = 100 + (4×5) = 120 years\nBaby's age = x + 5 years\nTotal of 5 members = 120 + (x+5) = 125 + x\n\nGiven average = 20:\n(125 + x)/5 = 20\n125 + x = 100\nx = -25 (not possible)\n\nLet me reconsider: Baby born now, so current age = 0\nAfter 5 years:\nFour members: 100 + 20 = 120 years\nBaby: 5 years\nTotal: 125 years, Count: 5\nAverage = 125/5 = 25 years (not 20)\n\nThe problem setup needs baby's birth to be in past.\n\nComplex Age Problem:\n\nExample: 8 years ago, average age of a family of 4 was 24 years. A child is born and after 2 years from now, the average age becomes 22 years. Find present age of child.\n\nSolution:\n8 years ago:\nTotal = 4 × 24 = 96 years\n\nPresent (8 years later):\nTotal of original 4 = 96 + (4×8) = 128 years\n\nLet child's present age = x years\n\n2 years from now:\nOriginal 4 members: 128 + (4×2) = 136 years\nChild: x + 2 years\nTotal: 136 + x + 2 = 138 + x\nCount: 5\n\nGiven average = 22:\n(138 + x)/5 = 22\n138 + x = 110\nx = -28 (not possible)\n\nThis indicates child was born after the reference point or problem has different setup.\n\nExam Tips:\n- When all age by t, average increases by t\n- For joining/leaving, find total change\n- For replacement, compare before and after\n- Draw timeline if problem is complex\n- Verify answer is realistic (positive age)"

Find the numbers.\nMiddle number = 27\nNumbers: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\n\nExample 3: Average of 6 consecutive even numbers is 15. Find the numbers.\nSince even count, average lies between middle two\n(14 + 16)/2 = 15\nNumbers: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\n\nSum Formula Application:\n\nExample 1: Average of first 50 natural numbers.\nSum = n(n+1)/2 = 50(51)/2 = 1275\nAverage = 1275/50 = 25.5\n\nOr use direct formula: Average = (n+1)/2 = 51/2 = 25.5\n\nExample 2: Average of first 20 even numbers.\nNumbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 40\nSum = 2(1+2+...+20) = 2 × [20(21)/2] = 420\nAverage = 420/20 = 21\n\nOr use formula: Average = n+1 = 20+1 = 21\n\nExample 3: Average of first 15 odd numbers.\nNumbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., 29\nSum = n² = 15² = 225\nAverage = 225/15 = 15\n\nOr use formula: Average = n = 15\n\nMultiples Average:\n\nExample 1: Find average of first 10 multiples of 7.\nNumbers: 7, 14, 21, ..., 70\nAverage = (7 + 70)/2 = 77/2 = 38.5\n\nOr: These are 7×1, 7×2, ..., 7×10\nAverage = 7 × (average of 1 to 10)\n        = 7 × 5.5 = 38.5\n\nExample 2: Average of first 8 multiples of 5.\nAverage = 5 × (1+2+...+8)/8\n        = 5 × [8(9)/2]/8\n        = 5 × 4.5\n        = 22.5\n\nRange Average:\n\nExample 1: Find average of all numbers from 10 to 50.\nThese are consecutive: 10, 11, 12, ..., 50\nAverage = (10 + 50)/2 = 30\n\nExample 2: Average of all even numbers from 20 to 80.\nNumbers: 20, 22, 24, ..., 80\nAverage = (20 + 80)/2 = 50\n\nExample 3: Average of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200.\nFirst multiple: 105 (7×15)\nLast multiple: 196 (7×28)\nAverage = (105 + 196)/2 = 150.5\n\nIncorrect to Correct:\n\nExample 1: Average of 20 numbers is 50. Later found that 65 was wrongly read as 56. Find correct average.\n\nSolution:\nWrong sum = 20 × 50 = 1000\nCorrection = 65 - 56 = +9\nCorrect sum = 1000 + 9 = 1009\nCorrect average = 1009/20 = 50.45\n\nExample 2: Average of 15 observations is 32. If average of first 8 is 28 and of last 8 is 35, find 8th observation.\n\nSolution:\nTotal sum = 15 × 32 = 480\nSum of first 8 = 8 × 28 = 224\nSum of last 8 = 8 × 35 = 280\n\nIf we add both: 224 + 280 = 504\nThis includes 8th observation twice\nSo, 504 - 480 = 24 (8th observation counted twice)\nTherefore, 8th observation = 24\n\nVerification:\nFirst 7 observations sum = 224 - 24 = 200\nLast 7 observations sum = 280 - 24 = 256\nTotal = 200 + 24 + 256 = 480 ✓\n\nOverlapping Average:\n\nExample: Average of first 10 numbers is 20, average of last 10 is 30. If average of all 18 numbers is 27, find average of middle 2 numbers (9th and 10th).\n\nSolution:\nSum of first 10 = 10 × 20 = 200\nSum of last 10 = 10 × 30 = 300\nSum of all 18 = 18 × 27 = 486\n\nSum of first 10 + Sum of last 10 = 200 + 300 = 500\nThis counts middle 2 numbers twice\nSo, 500 - 486 = 14 (middle 2 counted twice)\nMiddle 2 numbers sum = 14\nAverage of middle 2 = 14/2 = 7\n\nMaximum/Minimum Problems:\n\nExample 1: Average of 5 numbers is 30. If four numbers are 25, 28, 32, 35, find the fifth.\nTotal = 5 × 30 = 150\nSum of 4 = 25 + 28 + 32 + 35 = 120\nFifth = 150 - 120 = 30\n\nExample 2: Average of 6 numbers is 20. Largest is 35 and smallest is 12. Find average of remaining 4.\nTotal of 6 = 6 × 20 = 120\nSum of largest and smallest = 35 + 12 = 47\nSum of remaining 4 = 120 - 47 = 73\nAverage of 4 = 73/4 = 18.25\n\nRatio and Average:\n\nExample: Ages of A, B, C are in ratio 2:3:4. If average age is 27, find their ages.\n\nSolution:\nLet ages be 2x, 3x, 4x\nAverage = (2x + 3x + 4x)/3 = 9x/3 = 3x\nGiven: 3x = 27\nx = 9\n\nAges: A = 18, B = 27, C = 36\n\nPercentage and Average:\n\nExample: A number is 20% more than average of 40, 50, 60. Find the number.\n\nSolution:\nAverage = (40 + 50 + 60)/3 = 150/3 = 50\nNumber = 50 + 20% of 50\n       = 50 + 10 = 60\n\nTwo Averages:\n\nExample: Average of x and y is 20. Average of y and z is 24. If z = 30, find x.\n\nSolution:\n(x + y)/2 = 20 → x + y = 40 ...(1)\n(y + z)/2 = 24 → y + z = 48 ...(2)\n\nFrom (2): y + 30 = 48 → y = 18\nFrom (1): x + 18 = 40 → x = 22\n\nComparing Averages:\n\nExample: Average of 10 numbers is 20 and average of 8 numbers is 25. Which set has greater total?\n\nSolution:\nTotal of first set = 10 × 20 = 200\nTotal of second set = 8 × 25 = 200\nBoth equal!\n\n(Average alone doesn't determine which is greater; count matters)\n\nExam Shortcuts:\n- For consecutive: (First + Last)/2\n- For n natural: (n+1)/2\n- For n even numbers: n+1\n- For n odd numbers: n\n- For overlapping: count what's included twice\n- For wrong values: add/subtract correction\n\nCommon Patterns:\n- First and last group overlap at one point\n- Wrong entry needs correction, not replacement\n- When everyone ages equally, average ages equally\n- For range a to b: average = (a+b)/2"

      "content": "Learn efficient techniques to solve average problems quickly in exams.\n\nBalancing Method:\n\nWhen numbers are close to a value, use that as reference.\n\nExample 1: Average of 47, 52, 48, 51, 45, 53\n\nReference: 50 (middle value)\nDeviations from 50:\n47 → -3\n52 → +2\n48 → -2\n51 → +1\n45 → -5\n53 → +3\n\nSum of deviations = -3+2-2+1-5+3 = -4\nAverage deviation = -4/6 = -0.67\nAverage = 50 + (-0.67) = 49.33\n\nThis method is fast when numbers cluster around a value.\n\nGrouping Method:\n\nCombine numbers for easy calculation.\n\nExample: Average of 23, 27, 31, 29, 25\nGroup in pairs:\n(23 + 27) = 50\n(31 + 29) = 60\n25 (alone)\n\nSum = 50 + 60 + 25 = 135\nAverage = 135/5 = 27\n\nAssumed Average:\n\nAssume an average, find deviation, adjust.\n\nExample: 98, 102, 101, 99, 100, 103\n\nAssume average = 100\nDeviations: -2, +2, +1, -1, 0, +3\nSum = +3\nAdjustment = 3/6 = 0.5\nActual average = 100 + 0.5 = 100.5\n\nAP Shortcut:\n\nFor arithmetic progression:\nAverage = (First term + Last term)/2\nOr = Middle term (if odd count)\n\nExample 1: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30\nAverage = (5 + 30)/2 = 17.5\n\nExample 2: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19\nMiddle term = 11 = Average\n\nQuick Division:\n\nFor repeated numbers:\n\nExample: Average of 20, 20, 20, 30, 30\n= (3×20 + 2×30)/5\n= (60 + 60)/5\n= 120/5 = 24\n\nIncrease/Decrease Impact:\n\n1. When one number increases by k:\nAverage increases by k/n (where n = count)\n\nExample: Average of 5 numbers is 20. One number increases by 10.\nNew average = 20 + 10/5 = 20 + 2 = 22\n\n2. When all numbers increase by k:\nAverage increases by k\n\nExample: Average of 6 numbers is 30. All increase by 5.\nNew average = 30 + 5 = 35\n\n3. When all numbers are multiplied by k:\nAverage is multiplied by k\n\nExample: Average of numbers is 15. All doubled.\nNew average = 15 × 2 = 30\n\nReplacement Quick Method:\n\nOld average = A, Count = n\nNumber x replaced by y\nNew average = A + (y-x)/n\n\nExample: Average of 10 numbers is 50. Number 40 replaced by 70.\nNew average = 50 + (70-40)/10\n            = 50 + 30/10\n            = 50 + 3 = 53\n\nEqual Distance Formula Shortcut:\n\nFor average speed with equal distances:\n2v₁v₂/(v₁+v₂)\n\nMemory trick: \"2 times product over sum\"\n\nExample: Speeds 30 and 60 km/h\nAverage = (2×30×60)/(30+60) = 3600/90 = 40 km/h\n\nEqual Time Formula:\n\nFor equal time: Simple average\n(v₁ + v₂)/2\n\nExample: 40 km/h for 2 hours, 60 km/h for 2 hours\nAverage = (40+60)/2 = 50 km/h\n\nConsecutive Multiples:\n\nAverage of first n multiples of k:\n= k × (n+1)/2\n\nExample: Average of first 10 multiples of 7\n= 7 × (10+1)/2\n= 7 × 5.5 = 38.5\n\nNumber Sense:\n\n1. Average must be between min and max\n2. If all numbers equal, average = that number\n3. Larger numbers pull average up\n4. If n numbers have average A, sum = nA\n5. Combined average is weighted by counts\n\nMental Calculation Tricks:\n\n1. For numbers ending in 5:\nGroup and use 5s\n25 + 35 + 45 = (20+30+40) + (5+5+5) = 90 + 15 = 105\n\n2. For numbers near 100:\nUse deviations\n98 + 102 + 101 = 300 + (-2+2+1) = 301\n\n3. For fractions:\nConvert to decimals mentally\n1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25, 3/4 = 0.75\n\nOption Elimination:\n\n1. If average must be integer, eliminate decimals\n2. If average must be between a and b, eliminate others\n3. If average must be close to a value, eliminate far ones\n\nExample: Average of 23, 24, 25, 26, 27\nMust be 25 (middle term)\nOptions with 24 or 26 can be eliminated immediately\n\nBack Calculation:\n\nIf stuck, work backwards from options.\n\nExample: Average of 4 numbers is what?\nOptions: 20, 25, 30, 35\nIf given some numbers, try each option.\n\nVerification Shortcuts:\n\n1. Quick range check: Is answer between min and max?\n2. Reasonableness: Does it make sense?\n3. Extremes: If all numbers same, average = that number\n4. Sum check: Average × Count = Sum (verify)\n\nFormula Quick Reference:\n\n1. Average = Sum/Count\n2. Sum = Average × Count\n3. First n natural: (n+1)/2\n4. First n even: n+1\n5. First n odd: n\n6. Consecutive: (First+Last)/2\n7. Equal distance speed: 2v₁v₂/(v₁+v₂)\n8. Equal time speed: (v₁+v₂)/2\n\nExam Time Management:\n\n1. Easy problems (direct average): 20-30 sec\n2. Medium (combined average): 40-50 sec\n3. Hard (speed, complex): 60-75 sec\n4. If taking > 90 sec, skip and return\n\nPractice Focus:\n\n1. Mental calculation speed\n2. Formula recall\n3. Problem type identification\n4. Shortcut application\n5. Verification habit\n\nCommon Exam Traps:\n\n1. Average of averages ≠ Overall average (unless equal counts)\n2. Average speed ≠ Average of speeds (unless equal times)\n3. Including/excluding wrong values\n4. Counting errors\n5. Calculation mistakes\n\nFinal Tips:\n- Master basic formula first\n- Practice mental math\n- Use shortcuts wisely\n- Always verify range\n- Keep calculations organized\n- Double-check counting"

Calculation errors\n- Addition mistakes\n- Division errors\n- Decimal point errors\n\n4. Conceptual errors\n- Not accounting for time changes in age\n- Forgetting to include/exclude items\n- Wrong interpretation of question\n\nOption Elimination:\n\n1. Out of Range:\nIf numbers are 20, 25, 30, 35\nAverage must be between 20 and 35\nEliminate 15 or 40\n\n2. Obviously Wrong:\nIf all numbers around 50\nAverage can't be 100 or 10\n\n3. Close Estimation:\nQuick mental estimate\nEliminate far options\n\n4. Parity Check:\nIf sum must be even/odd\nCheck if average × count gives right parity\n\nPractice Strategy:\n\n2 Weeks Before Exam:\nDaily:\n- 20 average problems\n- Mix all types\n- Time each problem\n- Review mistakes\n\n1 Week Before:\nDaily:\n- 15 problems\n- Focus on weak types\n- Speed practice\n- Formula revision\n\nDay Before:\n- 5 easy problems\n- Formula review\n- Mental math practice\n- Confidence building\n\nExam Day Approach:\n\n1. Scan average questions first\n2. Do easy ones immediately (30 sec each)\n3. Mark medium ones for second pass\n4. Skip very hard ones initially\n5. Return to skipped ones if time permits\n6. Make educated guesses if needed\n\nSuccess Mantra:\n\n✓ Average = Sum/Count (remember this always)\n✓ Practice builds speed\n✓ Shortcuts save time\n✓ Verification prevents errors\n✓ Stay calm and systematic\n✓ Manage time wisely\n✓ Every mark counts"
