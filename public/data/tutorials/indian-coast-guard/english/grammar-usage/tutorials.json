Two singular subjects joined by 'or', 'nor' → Singular verb:\n- 'Ram or Shyam is coming.'\n- 'Neither Ram nor Shyam is guilty.'\n\n3. When subjects joined by 'or'/'nor' differ in number, verb agrees with nearest subject:\n- 'Neither the teacher nor the students are present.'\n- 'Neither the students nor the teacher is present.'\n\n4. Collective nouns (team, class, family) → Usually singular verb:\n- 'The team is playing well.'\n- 'My family is large.'\n\n5. 'Each', 'Every', 'Either', 'Neither' + singular noun → Singular verb:\n- 'Each boy has a book.'\n- 'Every student is present.'\n- 'Either option is fine.'\n\n6. Indefinite pronouns (everyone, somebody, nobody, nothing) → Singular verb:\n- 'Everyone is happy.'\n- 'Nobody knows the answer.'\n\n7. Some nouns plural in form but singular in meaning → Singular verb:\n- News, Mathematics, Physics, Politics\n- 'The news is good.'\n- 'Mathematics is difficult.'\n\n8. Uncountable nouns → Singular verb:\n- 'Water is essential.'\n- 'Money is important.'\n\n9. Distances, periods of time, sums of money → Singular verb:\n- 'Ten kilometers is a long distance.'\n- 'Five years is a long time.'\n- 'Hundred rupees is not much.'"
