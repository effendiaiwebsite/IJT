      "content": "**Central Tendency:**\nMeasures that represent the center of data.\n\n**1. Mean (Arithmetic Average):**\n\n**For ungrouped data:**\n**Mean = (x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ)/n = Σx/n**\n\n**Example:**\nData: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\nMean = (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = 30/5 = 6\n\n**For grouped data:**\n**Mean = Σ(f·x)/Σf**\n\nwhere f = frequency, x = class mark\n\n**2. Median:**\nMiddle value when data is arranged in order.\n\n**For odd n:** Median = ((n+1)/2)th term\n**For even n:** Median = average of (n/2)th and (n/2+1)th terms\n\n**Example:**\nData: 3, 7, 2, 9, 5 → Arranged: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9\nn = 5 (odd)\nMedian = 3rd term = 5\n\n**3. Mode:**\nMost frequently occurring value.\n\n**Example:**\nData: 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6\nMode = 3 (appears 3 times)\n\n**Relation:**\nFor moderately skewed distribution:\n**Mode = 3(Median) - 2(Mean)**"

Mean Deviation:**\n**MD = Σ|x - Mean|/n**\n\n**3. Variance:**\nAverage of squared deviations from mean.\n\n**σ² = Σ(x - x̄)²/n**\n\nOr: **σ² = (Σx²/n) - (Σx/n)²**\n\n**Example:**\nData: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\nMean = 6\n\nVariance = [(2-6)² + (4-6)² + (6-6)² + (8-6)² + (10-6)²]/5\n= [16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16]/5\n= 40/5 = 8\n\n**4. Standard Deviation:**\n**σ = √Variance = √[Σ(x-x̄)²/n]**\n\nFor above example:\nσ = √8 = 2√2\n\n**Coefficient of Variation:**\n**CV = (σ/x̄) × 100%**\n\nUsed to compare variability of different datasets.\n\n**Properties:**\n- If each value increases by k: new mean = old mean + k, σ unchanged\n- If each value multiplied by k: new mean = k × old mean, new σ = k × old σ"
