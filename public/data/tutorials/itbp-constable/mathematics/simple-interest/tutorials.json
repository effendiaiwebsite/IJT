      "title": "Introduction to Simple Interest",
      "content": "Simple Interest is a method of calculating interest on a principal amount. It is one of the most important topics for ITBP Constable exam and has direct applications in banking and finance.\n\n**What is Interest?**\nInterest is the extra money paid for borrowing money or earned for lending money. It is calculated on the principal amount.\n\n**Basic Terms:**\n\n**Principal (P):** The original amount borrowed or invested\n**Rate (R):** The percentage of interest charged per year\n**Time (T):** Duration for which money is borrowed/invested (in years)\n**Simple Interest (SI):** Interest calculated only on principal\n**Amount (A):** Total money = Principal + Interest\n\n**Real-Life Examples:**\n- Bank deposits and savings accounts\n- Loans (personal, home, car)\n- Fixed deposits\n- Borrowing money from someone\n\n**Why Important for Postal MTS?**\n- 2-3 guaranteed questions\n- Easy to score if formulas are clear\n- Practical and relatable topic\n- Forms basis for compound interest\n\nSimple Interest is called 'simple' because interest is calculated only on the principal amount, not on accumulated interest.",

      "title": "Simple Interest Formula",
      "content": "**Main Formula:**\n\n**SI = (P × R × T) / 100**\n\nWhere:\n- SI = Simple Interest\n- P = Principal\n- R = Rate of interest per year (%)\n- T = Time in years\n\n**Derived Formulas:**\n\n**1. Amount:**\nA = P + SI\nA = P + (P × R × T)/100\nA = P[1 + (R × T)/100]\n\n**2. Finding Principal:**\nP = (SI × 100) / (R × T)\nP = A - SI\n\n**3. Finding Rate:**\nR = (SI × 100) / (P × T)\n\n**4. Finding Time:**\nT = (SI × 100) / (P × R)\n\n**Example:**\nP = ₹10,000, R = 5% per year, T = 2 years\n\nSI = (10000 × 5 × 2) / 100\n= 100000 / 100\n= ₹1000\n\nAmount = P + SI = 10000 + 1000 = ₹11,000\n\n**Important Points:**\n- Time must be in years\n- Rate must be per year (per annum)\n- If time is in months: T = months/12\n- If time is in days: T = days/365",

      "content": "**Example 1: Finding SI**\nFind SI on ₹8000 at 6% per annum for 3 years.\n\nSI = (P × R × T) / 100\n= (8000 × 6 × 3) / 100\n= 144000 / 100\n= ₹1440\n\nAmount = 8000 + 1440 = ₹9440\n\n**Example 2: Finding Principal**\nSI is ₹450 at 5% for 3 years. Find Principal.\n\nP = (SI × 100) / (R × T)\n= (450 × 100) / (5 × 3)\n= 45000 / 15\n= ₹3000\n\n**Example 3: Finding Rate**\nSI on ₹5000 for 4 years is ₹1000. Find rate.\n\nR = (SI × 100) / (P × T)\n= (1000 × 100) / (5000 × 4)\n= 100000 / 20000\n= 5% per annum\n\n**Example 4: Finding Time**\nAt what time will ₹6000 amount to ₹7200 at 5% per annum?\n\nSI = A - P = 7200 - 6000 = ₹1200\nT = (SI × 100) / (P × R)\n= (1200 × 100) / (6000 × 5)\n= 120000 / 30000\n= 4 years\n\n**Quick Check:** Always verify using original formula after solving.",
