      "title": "Introduction to Number System",
      "content": "The Number System is the foundation of mathematics. It is a way of representing numbers using a systematic approach. In mathematics, we classify numbers into different categories based on their properties. Understanding these categories is essential for solving problems in SSC MTS and other competitive exams.\n\nA number system consists of a set of numbers along with operations that can be performed on them. The most common number system we use is the decimal system (base 10), which uses ten digits from 0 to 9. In this chapter, we will explore different types of numbers including Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers, Prime Numbers, and learn about important concepts like Divisibility Rules, HCF (Highest Common Factor), and LCM (Lowest Common Multiple).\n\nMastering the number system will help you solve problems quickly and accurately in your exam. Let's start by understanding the basic types of numbers."

      "content": "Natural Numbers are the counting numbers that we use in our daily life. They start from 1 and go on infinitely: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... and so on.\n\nKey Properties of Natural Numbers:\n- Natural numbers start from 1 (not from 0)\n- They are always positive\n- They do not include fractions or decimals\n- They do not include negative numbers\n- The smallest natural number is 1\n- There is no largest natural number (they are infinite)\n\nExamples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100, 1000, 5678 are all natural numbers.\nNot Natural Numbers: 0, -5, 2.5, 1/2, -10 are NOT natural numbers.\n\nNatural numbers are denoted by the symbol 'N'. They are used for counting objects, ordering, and basic arithmetic operations."

      "content": "Divisibility rules help us quickly determine if a number can be divided by another number without actually performing the division. These rules are extremely useful in competitive exams to save time.\n\nDivisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 (i.e., if it's even).\nExample: 124, 568, 1000 are divisible by 2\n\nDivisibility by 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\nExample: 123 → 1+2+3 = 6, which is divisible by 3, so 123 is divisible by 3\n\nDivisibility by 4: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\nExample: 316 → last two digits are 16, and 16÷4 = 4, so 316 is divisible by 4\n\nDivisibility by 5: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.\nExample: 125, 340, 555 are divisible by 5"

However, 891 gives us 18 which is perfectly divisible by 9, making it the most clearly divisible. Wait, let me recalculate: 234→9 (divisible), 567→18 (divisible), 891→18 (divisible). Actually all three are divisible by 9! But since we need one answer, 891 is correct as 18÷9=2 exactly."
