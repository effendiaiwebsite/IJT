      "title": "Introduction to Percentages",
      "content": "Percentage means 'per hundred' or 'out of 100'. It is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The symbol for percentage is '%'. For example, 25% means 25 out of 100, or 25/100, or 0.25.\n\nPercentages are used everywhere in daily life - calculating discounts in shops, understanding interest rates, expressing exam scores, analyzing statistics, and much more. In SSC MTS and other competitive exams, percentage questions are very common and scoring.\n\nThe basic formula is: Percentage = (Part/Whole) × 100. This formula helps us convert any fraction or ratio into a percentage. Understanding percentages is crucial as they form the foundation for topics like profit-loss, simple interest, and data interpretation."

Population Change:\nIf a city's population increases from 1 lakh to 1.2 lakh, increase = 20%\n\n3. Discounts:\nA shirt marked at ₹1000 with 20% discount costs: 1000 - (20% of 1000) = ₹800\n\n4. Profit and Loss:\nIf cost price = ₹500 and selling price = ₹600, profit % = (100/500) × 100 = 20%\n\n5. Simple Interest:\nIf principal = ₹1000, rate = 5% per annum, time = 2 years\nInterest = (1000 × 5 × 2)/100 = ₹100\n\nMastering percentages will help you solve problems in profit-loss, simple interest, and many other topics quickly and accurately in your SSC MTS exam."
