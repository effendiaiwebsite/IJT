      "content": "The Number System is the foundation of mathematics and essential for the Airport Authority Safai Karamchari exam. Numbers are the building blocks of all mathematical calculations we perform in daily life and competitive exams.\n\n**What is a Number System?**\nA number system is a systematic way to represent numbers using digits and symbols. The most common system is the decimal system (base 10) using digits 0-9.\n\n**Why Important for Postal MTS?**\n- Forms the basis for all mathematical calculations\n- Used in reasoning and data interpretation\n- Questions on divisibility, factors, multiples are common\n- Understanding number types helps solve problems faster\n\n**Topics Covered:**\n- Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers\n- Prime and Composite Numbers\n- Divisibility Rules\n- HCF and LCM\n- Factors and Multiples\n\nMastering the number system will help you solve 15-20% of mathematics questions in your exam quickly and accurately.",
