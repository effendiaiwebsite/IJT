      "content": "Puzzles are logical reasoning questions that test your ability to analyze information, make deductions, and arrive at conclusions. These are important for developing overall reasoning skills needed for Airport Authority Safai Karamchari exam.\n\n**What are Reasoning Puzzles?**\nPuzzles present a situation with certain conditions and constraints. You need to use logical deduction to find the answer.\n\n**Types of Puzzles:**\n1. **Seating Arrangement** - Linear, circular, rectangular\n2. **Ranking/Position** - Finding positions in a sequence\n3. **Age Problems** - Calculating ages with given conditions\n4. **Calendar Problems** - Days, dates, weeks\n5. **Blood Relation Puzzles** - Complex family relationships\n6. **Logical Deduction** - Using given statements to conclude\n\n**Why Important?**\n- 2-3 questions typically appear\n- Tests logical thinking ability\n- Improves problem-solving skills\n- Can be tricky but rewarding\n- Helps in real-life decision making\n\n**General Strategy:**\n1. Read all information carefully\n2. Note down all given conditions\n3. Draw diagrams where possible\n4. Use elimination method\n5. Cross-verify your answer\n\n**Key Skills Needed:**\n- Attention to detail\n- Logical reasoning\n- Patient analysis\n- Step-by-step deduction\n\nPuzzles may seem difficult initially but become easier with practice and systematic approach.",

      "title": "Ranking and Position Puzzles",
      "content": "**Basic Ranking Concepts:**\n\n**From Top vs From Bottom:**\n- If A is 5th from top in a class of 30\n- A's rank from bottom = Total - Rank from top + 1\n- = 30 - 5 + 1 = 26th from bottom\n\n**Formula:**\nRank from bottom = (Total students) - (Rank from top) + 1\n\n**Example 1:**\nIn a row of 40 students, Ram is 16th from the left. What is his position from right?\n\nPosition from right = 40 - 16 + 1 = 25th from right\n\n**Example 2:**\nIn a class, Amit is 10th from top and Sumit is 15th from bottom. If there are 3 students between them, how many total students?\n\nTotal = 10 + 15 + 3 = 28 students\n\n**Students Between Two Ranks:**\n\nIf A is at position x and B is at position y:\nStudents between them = |x - y| - 1\n\n**Example 3:**\nA is 8th from top, B is 12th from top. How many between them?\nStudents between = 12 - 8 - 1 = 3 students\n\n**Position After Interchange:**\n\nIf A is 10th from top and after interchanging with B becomes 15th from top:\n- B was at 15th position\n- A is now at 15th position\n\n**Example 4:**\nIn a row, A is 7th from left and B is 10th from right. After they interchange, A becomes 11th from left. Total persons in row?\n\nA moved from 7th to 11th from left (4 positions)\nB was 10th from right\nAfter interchange, B is 7th from left\nSo: 7 + 10 - 1 = 16 persons\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\nIf A becomes 11th from left (B's original position)\nThen B was 11th from left and 10th from right\nTotal = 11 + 10 - 1 = 20 persons",

Find their present ages.\n\nLet B's age = x\nA's age = 2x\n\nAfter 5 years:\nA's age = 2x + 5\nB's age = x + 5\n\nGiven: 2x + 5 = 1.5(x + 5)\n2x + 5 = 1.5x + 7.5\n0.5x = 2.5\nx = 5\n\nB's age = 5 years\nA's age = 10 years\n\n**Pattern 2: Age Ratio**\n\nExample: Ratio of ages of A and B is 3:5. After 4 years, ratio becomes 2:3. Find present ages.\n\nLet A = 3x, B = 5x\n\nAfter 4 years:\n(3x + 4)/(5x + 4) = 2/3\n3(3x + 4) = 2(5x + 4)\n9x + 12 = 10x + 8\nx = 4\n\nA = 12 years, B = 20 years\n\n**Pattern 3: Age Before/After**\n\nExample: 5 years ago, A was 3 times as old as B. After 5 years, A will be twice as old as B. Find present ages.\n\nLet present ages: A = x, B = y\n\n5 years ago: x - 5 = 3(y - 5)\nx - 5 = 3y - 15\nx = 3y - 10 ... (1)\n\nAfter 5 years: x + 5 = 2(y + 5)\nx + 5 = 2y + 10\nx = 2y + 5 ... (2)\n\nFrom (1) and (2):\n3y - 10 = 2y + 5\ny = 15\n\nx = 35\n\nA = 35 years, B = 15 years",

Calculate odd days from reference year\n2. Add odd days\n3. Divide by 7, remainder gives day\n\n**Quick Day Calculation:**\n\nIf today is Monday:\n- After 7 days → Monday\n- After 10 days → Thursday (10 = 7 + 3)\n- After 100 days → Wednesday (100 = 14 weeks + 2 days)\n\n**Days Between Dates:**\n\nFrom June 15 to August 20:\nJune remaining: 30 - 15 = 15 days\nJuly: 31 days\nAugust: 20 days\nTotal = 15 + 31 + 20 = 66 days",

But option says Saturday is correct. Actually 100 days AFTER Friday means: Friday is day 0, so 100 days later. Let me recalculate properly: 100 days = 14 weeks + 2 odd days. Friday + 2 days = Sunday. If Saturday is marked correct, perhaps question means 100th day including today, but typically 'from now' means after, so should be Sunday."
