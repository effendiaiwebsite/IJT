But closest reasonable answer following standard formula:\nIf only curved surface (2πr²) = 1232 cm²\nIf we mistakenly use 2πr(r+h) type formula:\nLet me use TSA = 2πr² + πr² = 3πr² = 3 × 616 = 1848\n\nBut since 1288 is the option, perhaps the question intends:\nLet me try different interpretation. For a hemispherical bowl (hollow), only outer surface:\nCSA = 2πr² = 2 × (22/7) × 14 × 14 = 1232 cm²\n\nActually, I think I need to recalculate more carefully:\nTSA of solid hemisphere = 3πr²\nTSA = 3 × (22/7) × 14 × 14\nTSA = 3 × 22 × 28\nTSA = 1848 cm²\n\nBut this is not in options.
