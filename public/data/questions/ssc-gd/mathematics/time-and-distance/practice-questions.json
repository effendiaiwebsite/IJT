      "explanation": "Given: Distance = 300 km, Speed = 75 km/h\n\nUsing formula: Time = Distance / Speed\n\nTime = 300 / 75\nTime = 4 hours\n\nTherefore, the train takes 4 hours to travel 300 km at 75 km/h.",

      "explanation": "Given: Distance = 150 km, Speed₁ = 40 km/h, Speed₂ = 35 km/h\nMoving towards each other (opposite directions)\n\nRelative Speed = Speed₁ + Speed₂\nRelative Speed = 40 + 35 = 75 km/h\n\nTime to meet = Distance / Relative Speed\nTime = 150 / 75\nTime = 2 hours\n\nTherefore, the two cars will meet after 2 hours.",

      "explanation": "Given: Downstream = 40 km in 4 hours, Upstream = 30 km in 5 hours\n\nStep 1: Find downstream and upstream speeds\nDownstream speed = 40/4 = 10 km/h\nUpstream speed = 30/5 = 6 km/h\n\nStep 2: Find boat speed in still water\nBoat speed = (Downstream speed + Upstream speed) / 2\nBoat speed = (10 + 6) / 2\nBoat speed = 16 / 2\nBoat speed = 8 km/h\n\nVerification:\nStream speed = (10 - 6) / 2 = 2 km/h\nDownstream = 8 + 2 = 10 km/h ✓\nUpstream = 8 - 2 = 6 km/h ✓\n\nTherefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 8 km/h.",
