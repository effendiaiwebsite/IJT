      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For divisibility by 3: sum of digits must be divisible by 3. For divisibility by 4: last two digits must be divisible by 4. Checking 132: 1+3+2=6 (divisible by 3✓), last two digits 32÷4=8 (divisible by 4✓). Answer: 132.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Prime factorization: 24=2³×3, 36=2²×3², 48=2⁴×3. Common factors with lowest powers: 2²×3 = 4×3 = 12. Answer: 12.",

      "options": ["28", "32", "36", "40"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using the formula HCF × LCM = Product of numbers: 8 × 96 = 24 × Other number. Therefore, 768 = 24 × Other number, so Other number = 768 ÷ 24 = 32. Answer: 32.",
