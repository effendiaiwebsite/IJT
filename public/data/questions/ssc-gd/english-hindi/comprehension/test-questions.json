      "passageText": "The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century revolutionized the spread of knowledge. Before this groundbreaking invention, books were painstakingly copied by hand, making them extremely expensive and rare. Only the wealthy elite and religious institutions could afford to own books. The printing press changed everything by making books affordable and accessible to the masses. This democratization of knowledge led to increased literacy rates across Europe. People could now read and learn independently, leading to the spread of new ideas and the eventual Renaissance. The printing press also played a crucial role in the Protestant Reformation, as religious texts could be printed and distributed widely. Gutenberg's invention is often regarded as one of the most important innovations in human history, fundamentally changing how information is shared and preserved.",

      "passageText": "Climate change is no longer a distant threat but a present reality affecting millions worldwide. Rising global temperatures are causing polar ice caps to melt at an alarming rate, leading to rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts have become more frequent and intense. Scientists overwhelmingly agree that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of this crisis. The consequences are dire: disrupted ecosystems, food insecurity, water scarcity, and mass displacement of populations. However, there is still hope. Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, protecting forests, and adopting sustainable practices can help mitigate the worst effects. Governments, businesses, and individuals must act urgently and collectively to address this existential challenge before it becomes irreversible.",

      "passageText": "India's space program has made remarkable strides in recent decades, establishing the country as a major player in space exploration. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has achieved numerous milestones on a relatively modest budget. In 2014, India became the first country to successfully reach Mars orbit on its maiden attempt with the Mangalyaan mission. More recently, the Chandrayaan-3 mission successfully landed on the Moon's south pole in 2023, making India the fourth country to achieve a lunar landing and the first to land in this unexplored region. ISRO has also launched numerous satellites for communication, navigation, and earth observation, benefiting not just India but many other nations through its cost-effective launch services. The organization's focus on frugal innovation and indigenous technology development has inspired other developing nations. With ambitious plans for human spaceflight and further planetary exploration, India's space program continues to reach new heights.",
