      "questionText": "In a figure series, a square with a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right is followed by the same square with the line from top-right to bottom-left. What comes next if the pattern continues?",
      "options": ["Line from bottom-left to top-right", "Line from top-left to bottom-right", "Line from bottom-right to top-left", "Horizontal line"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The diagonal line is rotating 90° clockwise each time. After top-left to bottom-right, then top-right to bottom-left, the next position is bottom-right to top-left. But continuing the rotation, it returns to top-left to bottom-right. The pattern alternates, so option 1 is correct.",

      "options": ["9 dots", "10 dots", "12 dots", "16 dots"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The pattern adds 2 dots with each figure: 2, 4, 6, 8. Following this pattern, the 5th figure will have 8 + 2 = 10 dots.",
