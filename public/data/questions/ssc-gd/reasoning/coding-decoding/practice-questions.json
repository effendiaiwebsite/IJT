      "options": ["OCPIQ", "NAPHO", "MANGO", "OBOIQ"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Using +2 shift: M → O, A → C, N → P, G → I, O → Q. Therefore, MANGO is coded as OCPIQ.",

      "options": ["mi", "ra", "su", "ku"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The word 'drinks' appears in phrases 1 and 2. The common codes in phrases 1 and 2 are 'mi' and 'ra'. The word 'cat' also appears in phrases 1 and 3 with common codes 'su' and 'ra'. Since 'su' must be 'cat' or 'milk', and 'ra' appears in all phrases matching 'drinks' or 'milk', comparing phrase 2 (no 'milk'), 'ra' must be 'drinks'. Answer: ra.",
