      "questionText": "What is the mirror image of 'CAT' in a vertical mirror?",
      "options": ["CAT", "TAC", "⊥∀Ɔ", "⊐AƆ"],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "In a vertical mirror, letters reverse left to right. C becomes ⊏, A stays similar, T becomes ⊥. The order also reverses. So CAT becomes ⊐AƆ.",

      "options": ["B", "C", "A", "F"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
