      "questionText": "The sum of ages of A and B is 60. A is twice as old as B. What is A's age?",
      "options": ["20 years", "30 years", "40 years", "50 years"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Let B's age = x, then A's age = 2x. Sum: x + 2x = 60, so 3x = 60, x = 20. Therefore, A's age = 2 × 20 = 40 years.",
