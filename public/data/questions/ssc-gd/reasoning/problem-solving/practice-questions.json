      "options": ["24th", "25th", "26th", "27th"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using formula: Position from right = Total students - Position from left + 1 = 40 - 16 + 1 = 25. Therefore, Priya is 25th from the right end.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A's 1 day work = 1/12, B's 1 day work = 1/18. Together = 1/12 + 1/18 = 3/36 + 2/36 = 5/36. Time taken = 36/5 = 7.2 days.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Let numbers be 5x and 7x. Sum: 5x + 7x = 144, so 12x = 144, x = 12. Smaller number = 5x = 5 × 12 = 60.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "If money doubles in 8 years, the interest earned equals the principal. So rate = (100 × P)/(P × 8) = 12.5% per year. For triple amount, interest needed = 2P. Time = (100 × 2P)/(P × 12.5) = 16 years.",
