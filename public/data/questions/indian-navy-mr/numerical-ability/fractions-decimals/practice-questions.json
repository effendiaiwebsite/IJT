      "options": ["2/5", "3/8", "7/4", "1/9"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "An improper fraction has a numerator greater than or equal to the denominator. In 7/4, the numerator 7 is greater than the denominator 4, making it an improper fraction. All other options have numerators smaller than denominators, making them proper fractions.",

      "explanation": "LCM of 5 and 10 is 10. Convert 2/5 to equivalent fraction: 2/5 = 4/10. Now add: 4/10 + 3/10 = 7/10. Therefore, the answer is 7/10.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "To divide fractions, multiply by the reciprocal: 3/4 ÷ 2/3 = 3/4 × 3/2 = (3×3)/(4×2) = 9/8 or 1 1/8. The answer is 9/8.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "0.625 = 625/1000. Now simplify by dividing both by their HCF. 625 = 5×125 and 1000 = 8×125, so HCF = 125. Therefore, 625/1000 = (625÷125)/(1000÷125) = 5/8.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Multiply as whole numbers: 5 × 4 = 20. Both numbers have 1 decimal place each, so total = 2 decimal places. Therefore, place the decimal point: 0.20 = 0.2.",
