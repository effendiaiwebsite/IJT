      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "0 is NOT a natural number. Natural numbers start from 1 and include all positive counting numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). Zero is not included in natural numbers, but it is included in whole numbers.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The integers between -3 and 4 (excluding both) are: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. Count them: that's 6 integers in total.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "29 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 29. The other options are composite: 27 = 3 × 9, 33 = 3 × 11, 35 = 5 × 7.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Let's check: 234 → 2+3+4=9 ✓, 567 → 5+6+7=18 ✓, 891 → 8+9+1=18 ✓, 125 → 1+2+5=8 ✗. 891 gives us 18 which is perfectly divisible by 9 (18÷9=2).",

      "options": ["6", "8", "12", "18"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "To find HCF of 24 and 36, we can use prime factorization: 24 = 2³ × 3 and 36 = 2² × 3². Common factors with lowest powers: 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12. Therefore, HCF = 12.",
