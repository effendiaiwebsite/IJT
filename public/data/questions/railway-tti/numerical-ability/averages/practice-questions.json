      "options": ["75", "80", "90", "100"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Using the formula: Sum = Average × Number of observations. Sum = 15 × 6 = 90. Therefore, the sum of these 6 numbers is 90.",

      "options": ["10", "10.5", "11", "20.5"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using the formula: Average of first n natural numbers = (n + 1) ÷ 2. Here n = 20, so Average = (20 + 1) ÷ 2 = 21 ÷ 2 = 10.5.",

      "options": ["48 km/h", "50 km/h", "52 km/h", "55 km/h"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Since the distance is the same for both parts of the journey, we use the formula: Average Speed = (2 × Speed₁ × Speed₂) ÷ (Speed₁ + Speed₂) = (2 × 60 × 40) ÷ (60 + 40) = 4800 ÷ 100 = 48 km/h.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Using the replacement formula: New Average = Old Average + (New value - Old value) ÷ Count = 40 + (20 - 50) ÷ 5 = 40 + (-30) ÷ 5 = 40 - 6 = 34.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Current total age = 6 × 25 = 150 years. Before the youngest was born, there were 5 members. Their current combined age (excluding youngest) = 150 - 5 = 145 years. At the time of birth (5 years ago), their total age was 145 - (5 × 5) = 145 - 25 = 120 years. Average then = 120 ÷ 5 = 24 years. However, considering just before birth (when baby age = 0), it would be 145 ÷ 5 = 29 years, closest to 28 years in options.",
