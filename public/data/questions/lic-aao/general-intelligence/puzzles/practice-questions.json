      "questionText": "Five friends P, Q, R, S, T are sitting in a row. P and T are not at the ends. Q is to the left of R. S is at one end. How many different arrangements are possible?",
      "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "S is at one end. P and T not at ends. So the other end must be Q or R. Q is left of R. Possible arrangements: S P Q R T, S T Q R P (if S at left), or T Q R P S, P Q R T S (if S at right). Testing conditions: S at left: S _ Q R _ (P or T in middle, one at end - but P, T not at ends). So: S P Q R T or S T Q R P. Actually, let me recalculate systematically.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "C > A > B (from first condition). B > D > E (from second condition). Combining: C > A > B > D > E. So C scored the highest.",

      "options": ["1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "D is on top floor (4th). A above B, so A is on higher floor than B. C on odd floor (1st or 3rd). If A on 4th, that's D's floor. So A on 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. A above B means if A on 3rd, B can be on 1st or 2nd. C on odd (1st or 3rd). If A on 3rd, C on 1st, B on 2nd, D on 4th. This works! So A is on 3rd floor.",
