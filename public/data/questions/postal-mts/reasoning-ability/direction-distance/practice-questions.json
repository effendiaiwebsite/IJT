      "options": ["10 km", "12 km", "14 km", "16 km"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The person walks 6 km North and 8 km East (right from North). Using Pythagoras theorem: Distance = √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10 km.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Start (0,0), East 5m (5,0), left turn North 5m (5,5), left turn West 5m (0,5). From start (0,0) to (0,5) is North direction.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Using Pythagoras theorem: Distance = √(15² + 8²) = √(225 + 64) = √289 = 17m. This is the 8-15-17 Pythagorean triplet.",

      "options": ["East", "West", "North", "South"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Evening sun is in the West. If his back is to the sun, he is facing away from West, which is East. Shadow falls in front (also East, same as facing direction? No, shadow falls opposite sun). Wait, if back to sun (West), facing East, shadow should fall East (in front). Actually, shadow falls opposite to sun: sun in West means shadow in East. If his back to sun and shadow in front, both are consistent - facing East.",
