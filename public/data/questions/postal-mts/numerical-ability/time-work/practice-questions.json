      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Work done by A in 1 day = 1/12. Work done in 3 days = 3 × (1/12) = 3/12 = 1/4 of the total work.",

      "options": ["5 days", "6 days", "7 days", "8 days"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using the formula: Time = (a × b)/(a + b) = (15 × 10)/(15 + 10) = 150/25 = 6 days. Or using LCM method: LCM(15,10) = 30. A's efficiency = 2, B's efficiency = 3, Combined = 5. Time = 30/5 = 6 days.",

      "explanation": "Total work = 20 units. A's efficiency = 1 unit/day. Work done by A in 5 days = 5 units. Remaining = 15 units. (A+B) complete 15 units in 9 days, so (A+B)'s efficiency = 15/9 = 5/3 units/day. B's efficiency = 5/3 - 1 = 2/3 units/day. Time for B alone = 20 ÷ (2/3) = 30 days.",
