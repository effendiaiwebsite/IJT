No reference to previous information.\n\n- **B (Second):** 'It also improves mental health...' - 'It' refers to physical activity from C. 'Also' indicates addition of another benefit, so must follow at least one benefit. Follows naturally after physical benefit.\n\n- **D (Third):** 'Additionally, it helps maintain...' - 'Additionally' means adding more benefits. 'It' again refers to physical activity. Third benefit in the series.\n\n- **A (Last):** 'Therefore, regular exercise is crucial...' - 'Therefore' is a conclusion word.
