      "options": ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "2 is the smallest prime number. It's also the only even prime number. Remember: 1 is not a prime number (it has only one factor), and 0 is neither prime nor composite.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "For divisibility by 6, a number must be divisible by BOTH 2 AND 3. Example: 12 is divisible by both 2 and 3, so it's divisible by 6.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Co-prime numbers have HCF = 1. For 7 and 11 (both prime), HCF = 1, so they are co-prime. Other pairs have common factors greater than 1.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Using formula: HCF × LCM = Product of numbers. So: 5 × 60 = 20 × other number. 300 = 20 × other. Other number = 300/20 = 15.",
