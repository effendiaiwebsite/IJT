      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "All books are novels, and all novels are stories, so all books are stories (I is true). If all books are stories, then some stories are books (II is also true). Both conclusions follow.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Draw Venn diagram: Flowers and Trees are separate. Trees inside Plants. Flowers could overlap with Plants (not necessarily separate). So I (No flowers are plants) doesn't necessarily follow. But since all trees are plants, and no flowers are trees, at least those trees are plants that are not flowers. So II (Some plants are not flowers) follows.",
