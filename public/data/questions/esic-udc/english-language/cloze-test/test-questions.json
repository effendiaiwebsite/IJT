      "text": "Passage 1: Education plays a __(1)__ role in shaping the future of a nation. It not only __(2)__ knowledge but also builds character and develops critical thinking.

        "minor",
        "crucial",
        "simple",
        "ordinary"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Blank (1): 'crucial' is correct. The passage emphasizes the importance of education in nation-building. 'Crucial' means extremely important, which fits the context. 'Minor', 'simple', and 'ordinary' all downplay the importance, contradicting the passage's positive tone about education."

        "imparts",
        "reduces"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (2): 'imparts' is correct. 'Impart knowledge' is a common collocation meaning to give or transmit knowledge. 'Removes', 'destroys', and 'reduces' are all negative and don't make logical sense with 'knowledge' in this positive context about education."

        "invested",
        "spent",
        "lost"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Blank (3): 'invested' is correct. 'Invest in education' is the proper phrase, implying spending money expecting returns. 'Spent' is grammatically possible but 'invested' better conveys the strategic nature. 'Wasted' and 'lost' are negative and contradict the 'remarkable progress' mentioned."

        "avoid"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (4): 'prioritize' is correct. The phrase 'education as a top priority' requires 'prioritize' (give priority to). 'Ignore', 'neglect', and 'avoid' are all negative actions contradicting the passage's advocacy for emphasizing education."

        "regression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (5): 'development' is correct. 'Sustainable development' is a common phrase meaning long-term progress. The positive tone throughout requires a positive word. 'Failure', 'decline', and 'regression' are all negative outcomes that contradict the passage's message."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (6): 'revolutionized' is correct. The passage discusses how the internet has dramatically changed communication and information access. 'Revolutionized' means completely transformed. 'Stopped', 'prevented', and 'blocked' are negative and illogical in this context."

        "connected",
        "isolated"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (7): 'connected' is correct. Social media platforms bring people together. The phrase 'breaking geographical ___' in the next part confirms this positive connection. 'Separated', 'disconnected', and 'isolated' are opposite in meaning and don't fit."

        "links"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (8): 'barriers' is correct. 'Breaking geographical barriers' is a common phrase meaning overcoming distance-related obstacles. 'Bridges', 'connections', and 'links' don't fit because you don't 'break' these (you build bridges/connections, or establish links)."

        "positive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Blank (9): 'health' is correct. The sentence discusses negative effects ('However, excessive use...'), so 'health problems' fits logically. The sentence structure requires a noun that can be modified by 'problems'. 'Physical' is an adjective. 'Beneficial' and 'positive' contradict the negative tone introduced by 'However' and 'excessive'."

      "explanation": "Blank (10): 'balance' is correct. 'Maintain a healthy balance' is a common phrase meaning keeping things in proper proportion. The context of managing 'between online and offline activities' requires balance. 'Imbalance' is negative. 'Conflict' and 'fight' don't fit the context of managing activities."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (11): 'impressive' is correct. The positive tone ('despite global challenges' suggests success) requires a positive adjective. The subsequent sentences describe positive initiatives and outcomes. 'Negative', 'declining', and 'poor' are all negative and contradict the passage's optimistic tone."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Blank (12): 'reforms' is correct. The context discusses government actions 'to boost manufacturing and attract foreign investment'. 'Reforms' (policy changes for improvement) fits perfectly. 'Problems', 'obstacles', and 'barriers' are negative and don't make sense as things government 'introduces'."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Blank (13): 'transform' is correct. 'Transform India into a manufacturing hub' means to change India's status. 'Transform into' is a common collocation. 'Prevent', 'stop', and 'block' are negative verbs that don't fit the positive goal of becoming a manufacturing hub."
