      "explanation": "Using BODMAS:\n48 ÷ 6 + 3 × 4 - 5\n= 8 + 12 - 5\n= 20 - 5\n= 15\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n48 ÷ 6 = 8\n3 × 4 = 12\n8 + 12 = 20\n20 - 5 = 15\n\nActually the answer is 15, but option says 17. Let me check: If the answer is 17, then 8 + 12 - 5 = 15. So correct answer should be 15 (option A should be 15). But if we check option B (17), there might be a different interpretation. The correct calculation gives 15."
