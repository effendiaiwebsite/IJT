Hmm, not in options. Let me recalculate: After 5 days, work done = 5/15 = 1/3. Remaining = 2/3. Now 15 men work. If 20 men take 15 days for full work, 15 men take 20 days. For 2/3 work: 20 × 2/3 = 13.33 days. Still not matching. Using man-days: Remaining = 200, men = 15, days = 200/15 ≈ 13.33.

Combined = 1/30 + 1/20 = 2/60 + 3/60 = 5/60 = 1/12. Time = 12 days. Wait, but answer shows 13.33. Let me recalculate B: If 2/5 work in 8 days, then 1 work in 8 × 5/2 = 20 days. This seems correct.

But we have equivalent of 18 women, so time = 10 days. Wait, let me recalculate: 8 men = 8 × 1.5 = 12 women equivalent. Total = 12 + 6 = 18 women. Since 18 women take 10 days, answer is 10 days. But option shows 9. Let me check: Total work = 12 men × 10 = 120 man-days or 18 women × 10 = 180 woman-days. 8 men = 80 man-days for full work means 80/10 = 8 efficiency. 6 women = 60 woman-days means 60/10 = 6 efficiency.
