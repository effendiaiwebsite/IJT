      "explanation": "Error is in part (B): 'have completed'\n\nThe subject 'Each' is singular, so it should take a singular verb 'has', not 'have'.\n\nCorrect sentence: Each of the boys has completed their homework on time.\n\n'Each', 'every', 'either', 'neither' are always singular and take singular verbs.",

      "explanation": "Error is in part (A): 'She is more smarter'\n\nWe should not use 'more' with the comparative form '-er'. It should be either 'more smart' or 'smarter', not both together.\n\nCorrect sentence: She is smarter than her sister and works very hard.\n\nRule: Don't use 'more/most' with '-er/-est' forms:\n- Wrong: more better, most biggest\n- Correct: better, biggest",
